almost every day its not in a bad way, though im crying because puppies are cute, because someone was kind, because i love my boyfriend so much i dont look at it as a drawback, i just look at it as making me feel more ""girly"" like all but one of my little crying jags was happy tears and after a week and a half, im probably up at least a half a cup size i put on my sports bra today, which normally has a flat surface between my two breasts this time, there was a noticeable dip between them, very pronounced and not subtle at all i think thats pretty unusual, to fill out so quickly, but again, im a woman genetically and by birth and just have a slight dysfunction with the organ that makes hormones so im not battling uphill against testosterone as some of the other users of this product may be, just filling a gap im not trying to be insensitive, im just trying to say this is a great supplement, but you probably shouldnt expect noticable boob growth unless you are in my exact situation it will probably take most mtf trans more time to notice a difference, as other reviewers have noted anyway, ive also noticed that pretty much all of my female body parts are getting a bit more sensitive, and my sex drive is up thats all i can say without being lewd, but maybe youve seen the cartoon archer look it up, its for adults, and its a very funny spy parody theres a line from the show thats just, ""sploosh"" it is said by the female characters on the show when they find someone attractive if youre reading this review, youre probably an adult, and you can probably figure out what im getting at honestly, if it were up to me, i wouldnt be cute about it at all im just making sure my review here is approved by amazon mehlong story short i havent had anything this good, aside from actual hrt i wish id known about this years agops oh wait i did break out a little at first, but it passed got a few pimples in the first few days, but it was very mild, in all the little annoying places i got them when i went through puberty with the assistance of pills, and then havent had any new ones ymmvgreat value for the productthis pill works my husband did some research on ""resetting my hormones"" because im dependant on birth control so i can get a menstrual cycle i was having too many symptoms of unbalanced hormones thinning hair, mood swings, tired all the time, not so pretty skin ect i always go for home remedies and this with another pill have worked for me and yes your breast will grow i was a true d and i would also fit into sister size dd now i have plenty of spillage and the dd arent really an optioni have noticed this pill has curved my apetite and i have also gained on the scale like pounds since ive been on it about weeks no big deal thoughtotally recommend if youre using it for hormonal issues or if you are looking for breast enhancementsi have taken now product multigland caps for men for more than years they no longer manufacture it but have made a number of individual products for liver or pancreas or kidney, etc i am almost done with my first bottle and things have been going well so far i have a lot of problems with some products making me sick but so far the transition has been smooth and easyi am a woman taking these for extremely low testosterone levels level was basically zero i feel much better since i started taking this along with raw female for low estrogen and chaste tree for low progesterone my muscles are growing larger and firmer, my sex drive has improved, skin tone is better along with my confidence and energy levelso far this has been a good product for me i have paired it with estopn and it works well together i havent noticed any side effects while taking this and most products tend to have something that i react to overall good product and companypros good sized product easy to swallow soft capsules no side effects noticed no strong tastesafter tastecons so far noneen mi opinin solo estrellas porque pens que eran soft gels pero son cpsulas en lo personal me gustan las soft gelsi make my own cat food need multigland for supplement the capsules come apart easily it dissolves well in liquid as i dont have a lab to know if the info on the bottle is correct, this is all i can judge by i would like to be able to get a bigger bottle, but this will do"

been spurned before overall im pretty happy with it, thoughive been pc gaming since middle school, but i broke my right arm when i was in high school i can use a mouse in my right hand fine for day to day stuff but between the scar tissue and slight nerve pinching that causes it to be uncomfortable, really uncomfortable for gaming for whatever reason using a keyboard in my right is fine though i guess because my hand rests on it differentlyive spent years, actually over a decade, looking for an ideal gamepad i ended up with a logitech g at some point and have stuck with it but i dont like it for mmos, basically not enough buttons combined with having to program different profiles for each game was rough i picked up something really similar to this device a couple years ago but it was angled a bit differently and used cherry mx black switches and it actually physically hurt my arm after brief play sessions minutes hence why i was worried about thisafter pulling all the keycaps off and spinning them degrees so i can use it vertically instead of horizontally and programming it its taking a bit of getting used to a slightly altered button layout but im getting there its not as comfortable as my logitech g but i figured it wouldnt be, but its way more comfortable than the similar product i tried a couple years agothe softwares easy enough to use, although id love a toggle to switch from horizontal to vertical not necessary, just a nice option for those of us doing that, and once i got it setup i havent had to run it againi could see this being a great macro keyboard for work use, but for me its a ""better than good enough but not perfect"" gaming pad im still tempted to start researching custom building my own so it could be more ergonomic but for now this will workupdate figured id do a ""ive had this almost a year now"" update its still a solid stars still vaguely interested in custom building something more ergonomic but havent felt the need to since i got used to this not perfectly comfortable for my needs but im used to it and its working just fine now the biggest complaint i have is that the manufacturer still hasnt listed this on their actual website and from i can tell the only response to ""where can i download the programming software"" is ""the url is on the manual"" neither is a huge deal, but i tossed the manual a while back and im curious if the softwares been updated at all and cant track down any website to download itupdate i bought another one old ones mostly fine, keycaps are dirty but i could clean them if i cared enough i was able to put my old one back into ""programming mode"" to copy the keymapping to a file, then load that file onto the new one, and i didnt realize how nice that would bethey did change the model a bit the shell feels cheaper, its lighter, the usb cable ports dont come with covers, the goldbronze colored screw caps on the top now are just formed bits of plastic in the shell its fine, but definitely doesnt feel or look as premium even though it costs the same it did come with a pretty basic set of black and white key labels you can use and a keycap remover which i dont think was included last time these labels are just the main keys, no ff row or other such ""uncommon"" keys az, to , and some punctuation keys i dont think the cost of these addins outweighs the cost reduction of the cheaper materialsbuild quality again, its fine, but for how much it costs i could get a similar quality full size keyboard granted, they probably have a special pcb, and a different kind of chipset so its fully programmable, but those kinds of thing shouldnt fluctuate the cost so severelyanother change is that the older model is flat, no angle, but this model has a very slight angle to the body if used as pictured its like a normal keyboard slant, but used vertical by my right hand like i do it leans the right up into my hand which is kind of fine its a weak enough angle that its not super noticeable and it probably helps shorten the distance my pinkie finger is reaching, so i guess thats finestill a solid stars from me, but the obvious cost reductions done without reducing the price are tempting me to drop the score theres nothing else quite like it for my needs, at least not without spending way more, so im just happy someones making stuff like thisi got this product to increase my workflow speed with design programs such as adobe illustrator, photoshop, indesign, and after effectsbefore this product, i had already been used to all of my regular hotkeys hand positions for the various programs, but i was worried that at some point i was going to obtain wrist issues with all the alt, ctrl, and shift key combinations on a daily basis most especially now that ive began working from homeonce i got this product, i quickly realized just how much time ill have to put into programming this to get back into my traditional workflowafter some time, i figured out my resting hand position, my most common keys, the best placement for the keys, and setup all of the hotkeys i use regularlyat the beginning, i felt like a newborn attempting to walk being honest i literally wanted to return the thing and go back to using my keyboard, but i was determined to use it because of the potential for it to be even better than a traditional keyboardthe most difficult part was remembering where all of the keys were, without having to shutdown the keypad, reopen the editor in programming mode, and taking a screenshot of all the currently set keysthis keypad did however come with color sets of keycap stickers for a traditional qwerty keyboard, black and white as i started to place my stickers onto the keycaps however, i quickly realized that itd literally be zero use if im going to have different key programmings for different profile setupsto explain if i place an a sticker on key , then in profile its fine but for profiles , ill either have to have key be the same a key to not get mixed up with the stickers, or not use the sticker at all in the case that i prefer key to instead be a combination of ctrlshiftfso i ended up taking off all the stickers i had put on, and the ones that were left on ended up coming off on their own within weeks mostly due to the heat from my fingers resting on them, likely causing the sticky part of the sticker to melt and dry up when its pops offi ended up switching out most of the white keycaps to my resting hand area so that i could use sharpie to write in letters, key combos, or symbols to dictate the tool its forwhich was half a mistake, as the sharpie would rub off even after a day of dryingthis issue is literally the only reason why im docking off a star from the overall rating, if there was a more convenient way to visualize the current key presets on screen per profile, then i think it would be an insane addition to this products functionalitythis product has literally become like my big toe for humans, if you lose your big toes, youll have to relearn how to walki dont use any of my design programs without my hand on this keypad, and my workflow has increased insanely to the point where i can very quickly get carried away with myself and do much more work than im supposed to i highly suggest this to anyone who uses programs that regularly uses key combo hotkeys its been the most convenient purchase ive made for my business so far, and ive actually been extremely tempted to buy a second one just so that i could imitate an entire keyboard layout with pads and be like a hackerman in a movieactually bought this a while back now that i retired i finally had a chance to use itdownloaded the software, simple enough to set up no issues getting it programmedhas a good feel to itbeing a left handed, and b a bit older, i found this unit great for game playingi play some of the older titles black mesahalf life series, etcthis lets me have everything i need right at my right fingertips without having to do any reachingi am pleased with the quality and sturdiness programming is easy and works well my only wish is that it came with a set of lettering stencils to label the keycaps i bought a black and a white fine point sharpie to hand write text directly on the keycapsthe unit is well made but it has functional limitations number of macros is very limited and the unit cannot be programmed on the fly you have to put it in special mode and disconnect and reconnect every time a change is required my requirement during programming is that i can store commonly used variable and other text which will change frequently i ended up returning this unit and used my existing logitech programmable keyboard with autohotkey freewaremy experience mirrors that of other reviewers who have complained that key combos on this do not work reliably and you cannot program the keypad to send rightshift alt ctrl plus a keystrokeif you just want it to send function keys, or regular alpha characters it seems to work just finebut shift something simply does not worki absolutely love this thing, it has mad emy workflow as a digital artist much more fluid and ergonomic the mechanical keys are nice and clicky, and the smaller for factor allows me to use this alongside my tabletmy only complaints arent very major firstly, this uses an outdated mini usb cable, not even micro usb let alone usb c, which not optimal at all and makes replacement more difficult secondly, the makers dont supply stickers for function keys like enter, alt, ctrl, backspace, etc which are all used in various editingcreating software, so prepare to create your own labels thirdly, and this is my only major complaint you can only program the keys on a windows machine the keypad is usable on macos, but to program the keys to your liking, you better have a windows machine somewhere, otherwise you are stucklove this keypad, perfect size and customizations for day trading i use a lot of hotkeys in the platform i trade with and set it all up for use on this keypad keys are very accurate and responsiveabsolutely fantastic product i have of them right now and more on the way i use for gaming, i have it mapped to adapt to most common control schemes i use another for content creationmy only gripe is the dated software used to program it it works perfectly reliably though so no issues on my end"

page",,69.95,in stock,1788,clothing shoes jewelry women shoes boots ankle bootie,"im actually so happy with these little elf booties i personally think they run big while in theory im a true like yrs ago, in actuality i cant remember the last time i was able to squeeze my feet comfortably in anything but an except for birkenstocks after two babies back to back followed by a year of high dose steroids i ordered these in a because i sized down a whole size to my ""true size"" before in uggs at review suggestion and they never really stretched out enough for true comfort this was likely a mistake they fit in the width though by no means tightly but are a bit long and after three hours of wear had considerably loosened all over i really should of purchased a at least so they would be fitted like a sock as they are meant to because im sure these are going to be way too big way too quickly but when they are ill use them for around the house and get a new pair for outdoorsthat being said, im not sending them back because i dont want to spend another day of my life without these shoes i purchased the black and its a true, deep matte black and the fringe is neutral and lays perfectly flat i also got them in the suede sole and im glad i did, i used to have a pair of suede sole mocs when i lived in seattle and even walking at least ten miles a day mostly on concrete in that weather which isnt optimal conditions for these types of shoes i didnt drive during those years the mocs lasted three years before finally developing a hole in more normal climates and usage these could easily last ten yrs live in texas and drive now lol dont believe people who say these cant be worn out of doors, they simply have to be seasoned properly by getting them wet and wearing on dirt and grass till the get slick and hardthe seude on these is perfect no its not the nearly nubuck softness of some higher end seude shoes i have but its not the rough cheapie suede either and in reality you wouldnt want a shoe like this to be any softer dont get me wrong, they are soft but they are thicker and sturdier than some suede which is just right one thing i didnt realize is that these booties have like some kind of memory foam insert which my old mocs didnt and this makes them even more comfy like wearing suede socks with some cushioning, i think if i added a little arch support stick on insert it would be like going bare foot with arch support and foot protection the zipper seems to work well but i could see where it could slide down i would say these may work better on people with a more delicate foot and smaller ankle because i have bird bones and it looks like if i had a normal sized to large sized ankle then they might be fitted and look odd they have enough room around my ankle and fit around my foot so well that they look ultra flattering also thanks to the simplicity and matte black of the shoes they also look more hip and less boho so far ive only worn these with a pair of slim fit, vintage boyfriend ankle jeans and they work perfectly adorable perfection i almost exclusively wear ankle length jeans due to my proportions and thats actually what i wanted a flat ankle boot for and these look super cool however i think these will also look really good with summer dresses and even leggings and tunics this winteri honestly didnt think i would like this, both fit and style but havent been able to find an ankle boot that worked for me so i decided to give these a quick try im so in love theyre surprisingly comfy tho i will add an insert i do have pretty nasty arthritis in my feet so im a bit particular about my shoes but these make me feel like i can leap about like an elf and my feet kinda look elvin too i cant think of enough good things to say about these booties no, they may not be for everyone especially if you have a wider foot or ankle and if you prefer true orthotics but otherwise these are amazing ive owned hundreds of shoes, many costing hundreds of dollars and these are surprisingly enough the absolute favorite shoes ever they have everything i could ever want in a shoe even my mom, who rolled her eyes when i said i ordered this, flipped out when i put them on and even more when she tried them on she hates completely flat shoes and has truly disformed arthritic feet and she ordered a pair an hr after i received mine plus she hates these kind of styles but thought these looked surprisingly hip and sophisticated for a moc bootiesoanother convert if you think these may work for you please give these a try but

insert aare so easy to useim sure that i will order more for future projectsi picked this up to make turning bottle toppers and a few other things easier, the nice insert making it a lot easier to mount on the lathe and install the bottle stoppersthe issue i ran into with this was that the driver worked to install the insert well enough but it also didnt want to release the insert and instead of leaving it behind in the wood as it should, it would pull it out of the time maybe a little lube on the threads will make that go easier the other thing i found was on about of the inserts the threads just rip right offim using the provided drill bit, driver, and inserts when they work they work well enough but the failure rate is a bit high for my liking i suggest using some lube on the driver threads to help it release on the way out i tend to use hardwoods for these projects so maybe the inserts need to have better material so the threads dont peel offi wouldnt say dont buy this product just know what your getting into and try to minimize issues by knowing that this can be an issue in some casesthis is an update after several more uses the main issue i have is the driver it gets stuck just about every time and i can back the drill off without pulling out the insert the driver needs to be redesigned so it will release from the insert way easier ive not wasted more money on trashed expensive wood blanks than this tool costi see a lot of good reviews and lot of bad reviews to clarify things a bit these are a well known and often used inserts for woodworkers of all sorts installing these inserts correctly requires that you have either a drill press, tapping arbor or have at least taken steps to ensure that the angle of installation is perfectly and consistently degrees to the entry point you will need to pre drill a pilot hole for these and the supplied brad point bit is a perfect fit in maple, but nothing in woodwork is a guarantee very dense exotics and the like would benefit from and may require an additional tapping step before installation the installation tool is really handy and safer than a homemade lock nut because its hardened thinking of doing this by hand and eye just dont you have a good chance of getting these stuck at a bad angle and wasting your project ive installed dozens of these with great results, but i struggled before figuring them out use as directed or sufferi tried to use these in hardwood, they were extremely difficult to install the tool broke off in the first one, i had to remove it and repair with a piece of dowel i wound up increasing the diameter of all the holes and applying paste wax to the threads it was still a strugglethe main problem with this kit is that it comes with a drill bit, which into hardwoods like oak, is too small and the install tool will just shred the top of the insert nut even with a bit it is tight and the top of the insert is often damagedso either the size of the drill bit needs to be revisited, the insert nut itself needs to be stronger, or it should be noted that this doesnt support use in hardwood and a different product offered in its placeif you are going to use this definitely test it on some spare stock of the same kind of wood you plan to use it with multiple times likely youll have to buy a new drill bit or two and experiment to get the right sizealso, i recommend using this with a drill guide or drill pressje narrivais pas bien visser mes inserts avec cet outils dans du frne a chappait avant dtre compltement visser jy parvenais beaucoup

kit is clearly too small, im building dining table out of white oak, luckily i decided to try these out on scrap wood first stripped of i tried to install before they even got close to being flush ill

last for decades, given the things that medical professionals often end up coming into contact with, so if you are looking for heavyduty work pants, these are not that i gave stars rather than , because i do need to add elastic, and because the stitching could stand to be a bit sturdier, but all in all, these fit my needs well, and the price is decenti got it in my size and it was too big the material feels kinda scratchythese pants are absolutely not for a woman with a larger waist they are cut completely straight, no curves, so if you have a large waist then the legs are also extremely wide they looked extremely baggy and unprofessional which i didnt notice right away due to getting dressed in a hurry that morning i wore them to work and my coworkers were staring at them like, what in the hell is she wearing they might be ok if you are very thin or tend toward a straight up and down figuresize of the scrub pants is larger than i expected i should have got size small good experiencei read the reviews and most of them said that you should size down i ordered a size large and they fit well i am full figured, bottom heavy with booty thick thighs , , inches size the pants are about inches too long but i am only "" tall pants are comfortable and light weight, no stretch glad i ordered in multiple colorsi am going against what has been said in other reviews concerning size i wear med, waist and bought med what i found when i tried them on is the drawstrings seem to work a little different most of us expect that if we grab the drawstrings and pull the strings out away from us, while pulling the garment back towards us, we can cinch up the drawstrings and tie them off what i noticed here is the drawstring coming out the right hole on the waist is actually coming from the left side, and visaversa not really an unusual thing, but uncommon i have gym shorts that do the same thing so instead of pulling the drawstring out away from your body, pull the left drawstring to the left and the right drawstring to the right and the waist should cinch upword of caution be sure to tie a knot in each end of the drawstring, else it might come out during the washi read the reviews about size i wear scrubs daily and wear them out pretty quick im and wear a waist inseam pant i went with the large and they fit perfect as far as scrubs go pockets are nice and handy no elastic is a plus and they tie securely with a single bow knot kinda thin but not see through dry quickly they wash well price is just what i was looking for i got the black ones and they go well with my stylish fruitoftheloom pocket tees i look professional, feel comfortable whether relaxing or saving the world with my intelligent application of exertion sometimes i work really hard too lotsa sweat but no chafing discomfort worn under anticontamination clothing in high heat and humid conditions perfecti was disappointed in these scrubs compared to my other landau sets that i ordered from a medical supplier, these are stiff, collect massive amounts of lint when laundered even when only washed and dried with other scrubs, and are a good inches shorter in the leg they are now my backup pair when all others are dirtyreally thin cotton but good quality, bit too big for me but absolutely comfortablela relacin calidad precio es la esperada, la tela no es la mejor calidad se siente rasposa supongo mejorar con las puestas levemente, se que en el modelo especifica ser unisex por lo cual no te da mucha forma pero ok eso lo dice lo que no te especifican es que es unitalla, en el pedido especifique talla s y me llega uno donde est etiquetado sml no me parece correcto, as que cuidado por que este asumo que es un m me queda relativamente flojo pero si le llegara a alguien que pide l definitivamente no le queda check the sizes carefully the size l i purchased originally fell to the floor even when tied to its smallest size m is almost perfect for a waist still too big because the waist strings do not go any tightertela sinttica me gusta mucho esta lnea de scrub zone, sub marca de landau porque es transpirable y luce mucho el color an despus de haberlo lavado varias

them i cant believe how excited i am about a trashrecycle can, but i am they are going to be perfect this can was perfect, for me, for three primary reasons i didnt want people to have to touch a lid, to put something in the can i didnt want to have to worry about rain its the perfect sizewe are not smokers, so i plan to put a plant, on top of each can, to cover the ashtrayi will send a photo, when our pool deck is finished happy summer, everyonei had asked before ordering if it took tall kitchen garbage bags folks said noi ordered it anyway thinking id just have to get different sized bags for it when it arrived today i went ahead and tried tall kitchen and they do fit to clarify, i wasnt as concerned about if the bag goes all the way to the bottom i think it actually does that too, put i put a brick in there to weight it down anyway my concern was it fitting around the top and securing and a tall kitchen bag does fit very nicely and even snuggly around the top of this gallon model that makes it nearly perfectjust fyi on other things i didnt get from other reviews or pictures regarding the ash tray it is pieces upper and lower the bin part is recessed and is attached with screws to the easily removable top plastic assembly so to empty the bin you have to remove top of the can and dump it nothing to it, just lifts up, and if you were going to empty into that garbage bag anyway and then the upper part you see and use when looking at it fully assembled is attached over the bin part at the corners with velcro tabs very sturdily and has a pyramid type shape to the inner section so the only part i am concerned about over time is when you lift the top part of the ash tray off of the bin part of the ash tray assembly which has to be done to empty the bin, the little screws that hold the bin part look like they might rust if they ever got wet and to wash the bin in sink for instance youll have to take the whole top to the sink and deal with that bulkiness did not warrant reducing the stars for me no biggie, just fyi but would be nice if the bin part and top part of the piece ash tray could both be removed from the lid i suppose i could remove the screws and fasten the bin in a removable wayill go to the building we put it at and try to take pictures of what i am talking about should have done that hours ago before placementi love this trash can for my large patio bigger and better than i expected just arrived as expected, but wasnt expecting it to be as nice as it is i got the beige or taupe im using left over trash bags that are gallon i had thought this was going to be a cheap plastic but its not i was going to sit a concrete block in the bottom but will not be necessary, as it will sit back on my patio under cover of patio so will stand up to wind love it, thank you sacco and amazonwe purchased this as an outdoor trash receptacle for our downtown offices where we have a lot of homeless folks who create a good amount of trash we wondered if we provided a place for them to dispose of their throwaways, they wouldnt just leave their junk on the sidewalk and in the guttersfinding the right receptacle was a challenge, and this one has worked very well for us first of all, we needed something that just couldnt be carried off by someone however, practical logistics required the item not be too heavy some outdoors trash bins are made of concrete and weight several hundred pounds, because we would have to maneuver the thing into place what we did with the safeco product was anchor it by putting two screwstakes through the bottom the same kind used to leash dogs in yards, then weighed the bin down with a pound bag of sand we drilled a hole for a padlock to hold the top of the bin in place, so no trash pickers could remove it to undo the purpose the receptacle was meant to serve then the thing was ready for business and we looked forward to see what would happenthere has been evidence that some have tried to wrestle the top off who knows why but both the top has stayed secure and the receptacle itself has not been budgedand even better news provide a place for people to put their trash, and they actually will use itall in all, this had proven to be a great productits very good product and they do stay behind and help they have good customer servicemoney worthi bought two of these for a store that i am opening these are the perfect size for entry trash cans since they are slightly larger than a standard kitchen style trash can and can hold a good amount of trash so its easy for any employee to empty it than an industrial size that is a pain to empty without needing another trash can to haul it to the dumpster highly recommend the only downside is that its made of lightweight plastic so it may require some weight in the bottom to avoid being blown over when its empty good value for the moneywe needed a waste basket on entering the building from the garage to the lobby with an ashtray just in case someone was smoking and this fit the bill its attractive and owners were pleased with its lookamazing you wont find better at this price easy to clean and maintain use the dimensions listed in the description for bag size gallon bags are the size i use and they fit greatvery happy with product, durable and exactly what i wanted quick delivery and great pricean excellent product having a covered outside garbage container with open sides is ideal for our situation a little light in the wind, but placing a heavy object in the container resolves this problemgood product"

polypropylene shell over a wood core that wont crack, chip, dent, flatten, flake, fade or peel like other wood seats super sanitary and nonporous the seat is easy to install with top mount hinges and corrosion free hardware beautiful highgloss finish available in several colors to match your bowl and bathroom decor fits all manufacturers elongated toilets proudly made in mccrery, arkansas, usa",,25.95,only left in stock more on the way,7782,tools home improvement kitchen bath fixtures bathroom fixtures toilets toilet parts toilet seats,"the round seat fits my commode perfectly, and so far its tight as a drum, not so much as a hint of movementthe whole thing seems very sturdy without being heavy or cumbersome looks good too, perfect matchthe plastic nuts that attach to the plastic bolts that mount the seat onto the toilet have a little projectile on each one i assume theyre a thumb grip but there wasnt enough room for the nut to turn against the commode so i had to get rid of the part that stuck out a lot harder than i thought very hard plastic cant be cut with a utility knife and a saw is too big a cutting tool such as dremel might work but i solved the problem rather quickly i melted the projectile off using a match if you try this take care not to start a fire, and i held the nut with a pair of pliers for better grip and to avoid any hot plastic be very careful not to melt into the nut itself or itll ruin the grooves and you wont be able to use itonce it melted down close to the nut i took a pair of pliers and broke off the remaining part while it was still hot it snapped right off with no trouble then the nut was clear to screw onto the bolt i did both nuts the same way, easy peasyi found this toilet seat easy to install its comfortable to sit on and seems to be solidly built i liked the fact that it came with large hinges and silicone seals that help keep the seat in placei purchased this seat to replace a broken one on my gerber toilet my biggest problem was matching the correct color, not knowing if the centocore color bone or biscuit was a match i ended up with the bone color and it looks goodfor the price, im very pleased with the quality as it is new, i cant speak to its longevity, but right now, it ticks all the boxes for mei posted some photos to give you a closer look and hope that they, along with my experience, help you out a bit with your choice thank youhow do you review a toilet seat it works, i dont fall in the toilet etcthis is the greatest toilet seat i have bought in the last years very sturdy for my pound body great supports under the seat if you are looking for a sturdy seat for heavy folks like me buy this one dr gf""quality"" is the best way to describe this product years of residential and commercial repair and maintenance and i have not installed any better that i recall its the sturdiness of wood and cleanup of plastic i dont think you can do anything better than installing this centorcore seatvery easy to install and looks sturdy and good qualityit is sturdy and was easy to installneeded a replacement seat for toilet at my mothers house this was very solid, affordable and easy to install and was perfect size to match prior seat be careful when lifting the plastic screw covers they are kind of fragile i pulled one up to install the plastic screw and it broke off but it fit back into place with no adhesive and has stayed on will purchase againim super impressed by this low cost, easy to install toilet seat this one is solid enough to carry my weight without buckling when im sitting on the lid i could never do this with the one i had purchased from canadian tire im super pleasedwow i went to several local stores, prices were crazy for this quality the seats were close to or morethe seat installed easily and what a big difference from the full plastic seat we had for years the plastic hinge snapped this new seat is really solid and will last a long time it does not have silent selfclosing make sure you check the type of toilet you have whether regular round or elongated double check the type and color before ordering fast delivery, excellent quality and price thanksnot much more to add as the other reviews cover it all i had trouble finding a toilet seat that would match my measurements, but i probably was overthinking it the length is pretty standard at for most elongated seats, but the width seems to very quite a bit within different manufacturers this fit my required inch width falling slightly short by about inch on each side the toilet bowl its not an issue whatsoever easy to install, a nice glossy white looks like it should hold up wellperfect fit on my very old low, elongated crane toilet replaced an old, discoloured plastic version this wood version is solid and doesnt have the ""give"" of plastic yet is very comfortable we all feel well supported sturdy doesnt shift it might with enough twisting and turning while seated, but in our family, we tend not to move around too much while were focused on the job at hand perfect colour match crane white such an easy install it actually took me longer to carefully for fear of cracking them pry open the hinge covers than to do the full install that would be my only negative comment the hinge covers are a softer plastic which felt like they could break off or crack easily if too much force was applied to open them, however, this issue would not stop me from buying again or from referral with the seat well positioned and bolts tightened, i dont expect to need to play around with those hinge covers any time soon instructiions for the uninitiated were a bit sparse, but its not rocket science nice feature to have the plasticsilicone thin pads to place under the hinges they probably go a long way towards keeping the seat in place its been in use for a few weeks now and were still thrilled with it i really mean thrilled who knew and the old toilet looks brand newafter a year, i threw it out toilet seat moves even after securing it tightly the bumpers dont keep it in place moved so much it bumpers regularly slid off the toilet bowl very annoying upon trying to tighten it the screw cap easily broke purchased a kohler k, already much happier"

paper,"our family of four buys one of these case boxes about once a year over the past several years weve tried similar papers from scott, envision, and tork i think were on our third case of this product and its been my favoritethe reason to buy these bulk cases of recycled paper is not because its the softest thing out there, its for the peace of mind first, it cuts down on the frequency of the concern that you might not have a roll of paper when you need it, compared to buying the supermarket or packs and second, being made of recycled paper, you dont have to think about virgin boreal timber being felled to service your nether regions and there is no plastic anywhere in this casethe other brands cover these merits just fine, of course the reason this product is my favorite is that the rolls seem to have the fewest problems with separation of the plies, misalignment of the sheet perforations, and overuse of whatever adhesive sticks down the end of the roll i occasionally get a tork roll with one of these issues, but seems to be much less than in the others weve tried and the softness here is the same or better than the other brandsi really dont understand the adhesive use

gluing is requiredstock up may be another shortageyea rightthis is a soft and thick double sheet tp, ive tried many brands of retail store brands and for the price this beats them all after using

line issue and having to waste many sheets that will not tear correctlyi have never ordered a large quantity of toilet paper like this before corona virus had caused all the stores to be sold out and i was running into the same thing on amazon then i stumbled on this tork product and it was available rolls i thought might be overkill but for the cost it was hard to pass up it was delivered in two

leaving lint debris so strong that even at ply, it doesnt break through at ahem the critical stage of wiping oh and each roll is packaged in tissue thin cotton wrapper no plastic note at the beginning of each roll, dont be alarmed by the plies separating and looking wispy this is just with the first five or so sheetsperfect if you need something in bulk for large families that wont clog up the toilet or septic tank not exactly the lowestgrade that you can buy either its not quite soft enough for me, but just fine for my husband and kids this saves us quite a bit of money and lasts easily months and thats with people using it compared to other paper in the same catagory, its better than mostgood product for a business not for home im spoiled so i have to take that in to consideration the rolls are typical for businesses even though they are ply they are not very soft so when my name brand goes on sale i buy that and give the the same amount of these to my brotherme and my family love it it has lasted so far months and i am still not out yet and dont believe i will for another or so weeks and this is for a family of , i think its a great value its two ply and you get a lot for less money so its a win win i would and have recommended it to everyone i knowupdate may th still use it and order it and still love it great value last along time and still cheaper then getting it from down town,when you need a lot of toilet paper and use a lot this is the one to get if u want to spend more money get less toilet paper dont look here because this will save you money and give you more toilet paper and it dont fill like sand paperall good just a little on the rougher side, but still gets the job done pretty good tp just having that many in one box is worth it"

assemble but fits almost anywhere, anywhere you need a rack for cables, network gear, sound gear this is your piecethis rack is a fairly decent piece of equipment but it really is very simple i bought this to hold all my cisco equipment that i used to study for certification exams completely unloaded, the rack seems a little flimsy but once you throw a couple of units in it seems to become more sturdy i wouldnt put anything that is exceptionally heavy on it or more than one rack unit though unless you ground it to a sturdier basei felt like the rack might topple if i put my hp rack mount server on it this rack might work well for a soho environment that needs some rack equipment, but without any temperature monitoring or control id be cautious about loading this thing up and letting it goassembly was a little bit of a headache, but once you figure out that of the pieces in the box are to secure devices, it gets a little easier i keep about unit devices on it with a rack mount power strip in the middle and it is doing quite well the rack gets hot if i power on all the devices, but just casual equipment tests work greatthe rack seems wellbuilt however the hardware bolts seem very undersized im sure this is by design to accommodate adjustment but it seems a bit excessive i will definitely upgrade the bolt size outside of that i think its a great product for the pricefantastic rack, especially for the price it could stand to be a little more stable, but thats easily enough rectified as it is with just a patch panel and small switch, its already doing quite well assembly was quick and easy though instructions could have been a smidgeon more clear, but it wasnt rocket science so doable enough withoutthe numbered indications and markings for each u of space is quite wonderful and handy the rack was actually a little shorter than i was expecting im sure its the right size, but for some reason i was expecting it to be at least a few inches taller all in all, easy setupthe packaging was a little worn, but otherwise in good condition with nothing sticking out all parts were intact and inside the box, with nary a scuff or scratch on the unit absolutely amazing product and experiencethis review is for the u sizei bought this rack and a u shelf to organize my home networking gear its pretty much perfect for the job my only tiny issue is that its about an inch too tall to fit under the table where i had planned to put it, but thats an easy thing to work aroundi was a little surprised that the box included both and screws the rack is, of course, threaded for , so i dont see any reason for the to be includedworked great for my home network lab needs i only used about u slots on it but the rack still wanted to tip backwards from the weight distribution for best results youll want to mount this to the floor or on a wider platform with casters to move around if thats your need assembly took about mintip dont completely tighten all corners until youve racked some equipment i thought i had the rack completely square but some of the holes didnt line up with the router ears i had so i had to loosen up the corners and install the router and then go back and tighten up the post rackused this for a home network setup in addition to the port switch and power supply, i threw some u and u shelves on it, and it works like a charmfor

want to use it on a date, forget it imagine she run her hand over your hair and it comes out full of this rough powdery stuff by the way, make sure you shampoo before going to bed or you will be grossed out by what you see on your pillow the next morningok, ill be perfectly honest here and tell you that a couple of years ago i went through a stressful enough period that much of my hair seemed to acquire passports and immigrate to someone elses head for real given that i have thin, fine hair and not a lot of it, it created some serious problems for me because being a woman with bald spots all over her head is harder to deal with than i ever could have imaginedso i started doing homework lots of it research that clearly demonstrated that my problem is not unusual, not easy to manage and has no ""quick fix"" of any kind but it can be managed successfullyi didnt want to go with rogaine for women because theres just too much negative feedback on it and because once you start using the stack of chemicals it contains you cant ever go off of it again which led me to surge shampoo a product with enough longitudinal studies to be able to verify that the inclusion of caffeine and other ingredients pretty much all of them recognizable and natural genuinely work on fine, thinning hair and hair loss when applied topicallybut i didnt stop there either i strongly believe that supplements are enormously important additions for anyone who doesnt have a perfectly balanced diet and honestly, i dont think there are many of those around or at least many who will freely admit that they dont so knowing what i do about vitamins, minerals and iron liquid form taken with vitamin c to make it easier for the body to absorb i searched for something of that nature that would work on restoring and building new hair follicles to use in conjunction with the shampoo as it turns out, there is a vitamin that contains a high enough keratin content among many other ingredients some of which are found primarily in the bcategory to aid not only in stimulating hair growth but also to increase both strength and thickness of finger toenails as wellhowever, all of those things take time and i was still going to have enough scalp showing to make me look like a virtually hairless cat whatever the breed that does that is so the gal who colors my hair counterintuitive i know but i need my hair to be damaged in order to give it more fullness and body shook enough eclipse onto my scalp baldspots to actually cover them almost completely my stylist says that most of its success lies in the fact that, like a good ""foundation"" for the face, it actually acts to eliminate the shine that made my scalp so visible but the fibers that act to both ""fill and cover"" those spots are colored for a reason to match your hair color and darken your scalp while also eliminating the ""shiny"" on your skincovered skull those fibers attach themselves to both the ""baby fuzz"" hair follicles and to the skin in between them so although im now using less of it, i needed that coverage enough that, at the time, i was going through almost a full container a month waiting for the vitamins and the surge to start working their magic as welloh, and for what its worth, the fibers in eclipse will stay on your head until the next wash whether its every day, every other day or once every days is it worth it absolutely just ask that previously almost bald lady that would be me folks who is now only using it for selective ""spot coverage"" and whose little bottles of magic are now lasting for months plural instead of just every weeks or so honestly, if my colorist hadnt had samples to use on my head to demonstrate the advantages of this little miracle in a bottleworks welli have been using eclipse hair fibers and refill fibers that i fill up the eclipse bottle buying refill fibers is a cost effective method to save money fibers are easy to use, just lightly sprinkle the fibers on the thin areas of your head i also use isos after the fibers by using the isos, i dont have to tease my hair, just lift the hair, style, then spray i am so thankful i learned about the fibers when you buy the eclipse bottle, the lid is removable, and use the refill fibers to refill the bottle i definitely recommend fibers if your hair is thin, and you can see your scalp amazing productthis covers so well this price is the best around for this productmy hairdresser turned my on to this i feel like i have a little thinning on top and after you do your hair, just shake the can and sprinkle a little on your head it masks the thinning a little it seems to put a color filler in like power but so lightly that you cant tell love itive used eclipse now for several months and am very pleased with it it really fills in and makes my hair look better my scalp can become a little itchy at the end of the day and i just brush the product out i highly recommend itthey a false advertising as the description says a

slownow honestly, moving gigabites in volume is a lot of bits to move, so but it clearly is usable as back up storrage only and not for live use of anything beyond looking at a small sized jpgi am not unhappy, if it holds up as back up storrage, but will need to find additional solutionsthis is great copies quickly, a one mb folder was completely copied in a little over a minute no problems at allas noted in other reviews it worked right out of the pkg on my macbook pro wo any formatting used solely to store my tens of thousands photos bottom gets pretty warm as it is a hdd not an ssd write speed is slow but i knew that when i bought it for the price device side of cable appears proprietary see photo didnt use any of the sw provided on the drive nameplate says made in thailand in first i love the compact size and then the price for t is very good it wasnt hard to set up with my macbookpro once i went through the downloaded installer and was able to go to the time machine in my system preferences and check this as my preferred backup device the first backup is a little over one hour but i have a lot to download so the time to do this is fine with me i also liked the fact that it came with a usbc adaptor so i didnt have to go to an apple dongle i have used g drives in the past but the prices are extremely high now if all you are doing is backing up to your personal computer i am not a tech savvy person but i didnt need any tech support to get this runningi can use it to secure my important documentsi am using this to back up photos and video clips to relieve brain space on my mac of course, i have another of a different brand as well as extra backup i had no problems formatting and was able to start dragging dropping files immediately great price for tb and a good solution compared to the many, many flashdrives of every highrated brand under the sun that has failedits a fine hard drive for the price, but i bought this because i thought it used a usbc connection instead, its a proprietary connection leading to a usbawith an a to c adapter that means one more thing to remember every time i want to connect this hard drive to a modern computeri loved this thing since i got it at the tail end of i save all my important docs, pictures, emulators, etc on this drive i do not use it for automated backup and i use a miscrosoft surface book my issue with this hard drive is sometimes it takes a while for it to load after putting in my password the high probability of constantly troubleshooting and losing all of my precious data freaks me out i can deal with unplugging and replugging once or twice to get it to work tonight i tried to get it to load for hours, doing combinations of laptop restarts, unplugging and replugging, switching power cords, trying to use toolkit to deactivate the password feature thats where it always seems to freeze and stop responding it seems like it doesnt stay powered on long enough through the loading process and just stops responding i have not tried calling customer support yet as its almost est as of this writing, but i may try tomorrow if it is something that is easily fixed, i would love to give it starsupdate i was finally able to disable password encryption and no issues stars only because im not sure if it will act up again when i reenable itbroken down and died after week i called seagate, the told me it could happen because the drive is very sensitive how can that be an excuse i lost all my datathe star is for amazon returned withought questioni have always used seagate hardrives in the past and i work with large files daily and this was a disappointment paid about for the tb and i was expecting it to be pretty fast i tried to transfer a gb file from my macbook pro to my ssd and it took nearly mins i was also really disappointed with the usbc adapter it came with, it feels cheap and was super loose and kept disconnecting easily from my macbook tried transferring a gb file from my husbands pc laptop, took mins and seconds very disappointed now i have to spend more money and see if a usbc to microb cable would work for this instead or better yet return this and find a better hard drivegreat product but, if you have a mac and are doing your backups in time machine, you should know that if you use this as your storage, you can only store the time machine backups on it nothing else this means you cant drag folders or add extra photos or anything like thisalso, it does take a bit of figuring out to format the disk to be compatible to do the time machine backups, but once thats done it works finethis drive did not work out for me it was defective for sure, it would disconnect and stop running while transferring large files eventually it was unreadable on two laptops, which it somehow manages to freeze the laptops and a reboot had to happen i had a lot of data to transfer and was unable to finish i was able to format the drive after several attempts so i can return it i wouldnt recommend it for large data transfer"

calories you are ingesting on super long rides these are easy on the stomach, and provide enough calories to supplement my liquid nutrition they are really easy to carry and open while ridingi swear by the gu roctane products to aid in my cycling these help pick you up and have a kick of caffeine in them as well the flavor works on hot and cold days, not too overpowering i keep on me on all of my longer rides a must have for endurance trainingridingi run miles per week i use these for long runs miles and marathons gels are all pretty much the same price, unless you buy in to the maurten hype and want to pay double for a gel i know, flavor and effectiveness is going to be very subjective depending on the athlete, but ive tried the rest and these are the best at least for me blueberry pom doesnt have lifechanging flavor, but then no gel ive tried does but it doesnt have a funky lingering aftertaste either, as some gelsflavors can its small enough to fit into the tiny pockets of runners shorts its thick enough so i can safely open it and take my time ingesting it while running, avoiding messy leaks no sticky hands and chin like other gelsi like to run long distances miles and these make such a huge difference in performance and mental claritybarely enough caffeine for me to notice but enough to give you that little boosteasy to digest and great flavori never run without theseupdate sep ive been using the blueberry pomegranate for over a year now in many races the taste is ok but my runner partners all hate it for some reason the cherry lime tastes better, but if you hated the blueberry pomegranate, youll probably hate the cherry lime honestly, when im tearing down the roadtrail in a race, i couldnt care less about taste im sucking down that gel pack and looking for a bit of hydration, while trying to maintain a competitive pace, locate a garbage can refuse drop zone, and try to finish a race i only use the gels at the beginning of a race, or in the middle if it is longer than minutes like a k, miler, half marathon, etcoriginal reviewi purchased the blueberry pomegranate flavor and am glad i did so because it tastes great it tastes just like their chews, except in semiliquid form it goes down very easily without the need for water i find that it really does give me the energy i need to finish my race or activity the instructions say to take it minutes before, and every minutes afterwards my stomach doesnt digest stuff as quickly, so i have to experiment with how early to take it prior to a raceif youre going to run a race or participate in an event longer than minutes, i highly recommend packing these gels so far, the bcaas have not upset my stomach the caffeine really does workid been using the normal gu for quite some time vanilla bean flavor and found that it worked fairly well the occasional minor stomach issue, but no big deal ive never been a big fan of the very thick consistency, and since i was working my way through a large box the vanilla flavor started getting on my nervesi decided to ""upgrade"" to roctane and thought that switching over to something with a fruit flavor would help break me out of my vanilla rutthe good roctane has a considerably thinner consistency, which is awesome easier to eat, doesnt coat the mouththroat as much, and feels much easier on the stomach i also feel like the extra caffeine gives me a small bonus boost and the bcaas i have no clue, but apparently they help with carb uptake i cant measure that energy levels feel pretty much the same, but maybe a bit faster acting with roctane could be totally psychological since these things are damn expensive and i want them to work betterthe bad the cherry lime flavor that i bought tastes like jellied, chemicalinfused regret ugh almost laughably bad i brought two roctanes and a plain gu vanilla bean on a recent long run, and ate the roctanes first the vanilla gu was like a delicious special treat after the roctanesso, four stars,

claw and fingertip styles the razer deathadder v continues this legacy, retaining its signature shape while shedding more weight for quicker handling to improve your gameplay going beyond conventional office ergonomics, the optimized design also provides greater comfort for gamingimportant for those long raids or when youre grinding your rank on ladder",,58.2,only left in stock order soon,14407,video games pc accessories gaming mice,"although ive never cared for the aesthetics or branding its very tryhard and aimed at teenagers in of razer the overall build quality, ergonomics, and responsiveness of the mouse overcome any reservationsthis is a wired mouse but unlike traditional hard rubber coated mouse cables this one is wrapped in a soft but sturdy woven material it makes it so it doesnt noticably resist as traditional mouse cables would which allows for smooth operation and makes for easy cable management not having to charge is great and makes the mouse light for its sizethe size is fairly large, a bit larger than im personally used to but not so much that its uncomfortable for most women or kids it might be too large thoughit has lights with presets that can be turned off with razers software that you have to download unfortunately, if youre into that i turn mine off or on the lowest setting as i find them distractingthe buttons are nice and clicky and very fast they are pretty sensitive with very little pressure needed to engage useful for gaming but not so sensitive that youll misclick at least for me there are main buttons, all programmable, more than most people need but theyre good to have the mouse wheel is nice and clicky and operates smoothly the only thing i wish it had was a fast scroll option but this typically more useful when browsing than gaming its a compromise that i can understand the extra buttons vs a button mouse dont get in the way and are useful in a variety of games i often use them as additional movement buttonsthe tracking is very very sensitive if youre used to an office mouse but this is also fully adjustable for your own comfort and ability the mouse also physically slides very smoothly across a mouse pad i havent tried it on other surfaces like glass or white tables which traditionally can sometimes give laser mice issuesmy only gripe as others have pointed out is the main buttons can be a little bit wobbly if pushed from the side this isnt something you would do while gaming but again as others as said if you were traveling with it you would want it in a hard case if it has the chance of getting knocked around at allso overall i would recommend this mouse for pretty much any task or game it does everything a mouse should do and it does it wellso my wireless logitech g mouse is years old and starting to show signs of aging as such, ive decided to once again start trying out some new gaming micethis time though, ive refocused my search on wired mice as wireless mice are said to have enough latency to affect gameplay im not sure if that is relevant to a noncompetitive casual player like myself, but im giving it a tryso i went with the razer deathadder v because the form factor is very close to my , and i love this button configuration i have played a few games with it today and kind of felt like my wrist was raised a bit too high and it was causing some fatigue and discomfort for those who dont know, along with many other parts of my body, my wrists are also jacked upthe mouse also feels much lighter than my , so much so that it feels kind of weird i think if i play with it for a while, i might adapt to it but since there are so many other options available today, why settle on your first tryoverall, i actually like the mouse for what it is once i got the sensitivity right it was all good but the front of it just feels like its raised just a bit too high which then causes the aforementioned fatiguesomeone suggested i try the basilisk v, and upon a quick glance it appears to meet the twobutton requirement i have for the side, with an additional two others i may have already tried this, but honestly after mice trials, if i didnt write the review then, i wont remember thats why im doing this one right away for my initial thoughts im going to use it a bit longer and i think i might give the basilisk a try if i do you know it will end up here right awaylo he probado ya mucho tiempo casi el ao y me ha funcionado perfectamente, para juegos es brutal super bueno para cualquier tipo de actividad, el sofware lo instale y me parece perfecto pero para las cosas que yo hago no fue necesario la asignacion de nuevas teclas, no escogi otra version de renovados aunque estaban economicos pero en estos casos dd perifericos prefiero lo nuevo, no me arrepenti de mi compra y respeto al ultimate cableado no es de mi agrado por los botones que trea al lado derecho ya no son tan ergonomicos a mi gusto, por eso escogi este por mo tipo de agarre y tamao de mi mano, la iluminacion super excelente, todo es un mause de buena calidsd si lo consigues por buen precio, te da mas de lo que pagas por elthis is a review of the deathadder v, not the elite as some of the reviews on this page are for not sure if thats a bug, but deathadder elite reviews should be on the elite page not the vto preface this, just wanted to say that im by no means bragging or boasting, just giving my cents as someone who has played at one of the highest levels of cs i played eseapremiermdl as well as cevo p my first ever gaming mouse was the deathadder, loved the original shape and its been my main mouse ever sincei have tried just about as many other alternatives as i can including the zowie ec a, zowie ec, finalmouse, steelseries rival, logitech g, xtrfy m, etc i always somehow going back to the deathadder because of its shape, i guess ive just gotten so acclimated to it since ive gone through about of them, some have been due to wear from the left trigger button, and one because the side buttons stopped working though one of the biggest issues for me has always been the cheap and horrendous side grips which always fall off after months hot glue, gorilla glue, nothing would make it stay so after countless iterations of the deathadder, finally the v has addressed this issue and moremajor changes that are small but absolutely game changingside grips are now integrated into the left and right side of the mouse, they are a physical part of the shell and therefore cannot fall off, this makes cleaning easierk dpi is absurd but the sensor is improved and has a higher ips than the elitemouse skates are similar to the elite and are now two much larger pads that cover the top and bottom of the mouse, much better than the previous tiny skates they had priorthe shape on the right mouse button has been ever so slightly adjusted, it doesnt flare out as much and feels more comfortable to gripweight has been reduced to gthe dpi buttons, which i dont use, are more spaced out and therefore avoids accidental hittingmouse switches are optical, theyre not as loud and feel just as responsive as beforeall in all, this is definitely the best iteration of the deathadder theyve put out it improves on things that have been a hinderance on every model since i am not a pro gamer or anything but i can definitely say this mouse is incredible i came from a cheap logitech m productivity mouse of dpi but the deathadder v with dpi is a gamechanger for me i use it at around dpi and everything feels so much more responsive and accurate i have mediumsized hands and this feels a bit big for me but i got used to itall the extra buttons work on macos the top two small buttons work for changing dpi thumb buttons work on chrome for navigating webpages forward or backward didnt work on firefox i think the buttons worked after i installed synapse on windows through bootcamp and configured itconsthere is no synapse on macos, which is a big downer for me i can still store profiles using synapse on windows thoughprosergonomicsuper responsivevery lightweightall the extra buttons work on macosrazer software caused my computer to act up computer was running fine until i plugged in the razer, started having boot issues and wasnt able to use the mouse in bios i think this mouse is over priced too i dont think i trust razer at this point had to reformat my computer because of thisedit months later so the th mouse still has loose clicks, feels spongy and cheap, and now the scroll wheel is creaking very loudly and grinding when scrolling upwards absolutely pathetic qc for these units in my opinion and razer support is notoriously horrible at customer service im going to rma it but use it as a backup once i buy a mouse thats not trashedit got a th, it still has issues scroll wheel feels and sounds really cheap, left click is rather loose, razer support is absolutely horrible after month of back and forth emails all they offered me was a off coupon from their website, which would only barely cover the shipping, and give me off the productedit got a th one just to be sure, it also has left click issues and a creaky right side bottom buyer beware think ill look at logitech and corsair insteadthe mouse itself is great, performance is exactly what youd expect its like my chroma was, but better, lighter, fasterthat being said, the first deathadder v i purchased had a very loud scroll wheel that would vibrate the mouse when using, the nd one had inconsistent click on the right left side the right mouse button protruded a little to the right, and required more force to click down the third one i just received, had no mouse click issues, but the same loud scroll wheel that was actually worse than the first onemight be worth mentioning theyre all from taiwan, not chinareally lost faith in razer qc as these mice are all brand new, and frankly not cheap at cadok after the first og deathadder i had every single version of this legendary mouse but since the v version with optical switch which is really the only way i tough it would get rid of thoses old all kinds of contacts switchs omron, and all variants so back to the wired version v didnt like the right click being really moushy and feel like cheaply made so i did return it then the v pro wireless came and was on a really good deal at cad off is a freaking nice deal and theres the culprit even razer said nd gen optical switch tought it would be better right honestly same rediculious problem right click is so moushy and feel so cheap that disappointing the only good is its wireless but for me sadly the deathadder is dead bad product quality never again stilk miss the old og rubberized texture instead of cheap platic sand paper feel if i could give i would im sorry but save your money find an alternative but for me ill keep my mamba wireless even if a lot of people didnt like it mine still hold after a year without double click on any right or left side i will expect to happen soon or late and will beed a switch swap job im not afraid of"

accessories women accessories,"used them for a nandor cosplay after doing some research i decided to go with these even though they were a little bit more expensive worth it i tried one of the cheaper ones years ago, and i hated those little capsule things you would use to adhere then the stuff scarecrow uses is great it lasted over a day weekend and they are still holding up not sure about other complaints, but trust me these are better than the cheap onesthey match my teeth and stay put, and look like real teethwhat more could you ask forps wash them after usei have always loved the scarecrows brand vampire teeth, they are very sturdy and easy to placei bought these because i loved the design of the fangs, however they seemed to be too big for my teeth following along with the instructions i made one of the capsules, put it into the fang and onto my tooth at first it seemed to work and then i realized that i needed a bit more of the adhesive, and then it worked i tried repeating the process on my other tooth and had no success of the tooth taking part of me believes that this experience is due to the size of my teeth i believe wholeheartedly that this product would have work if my teeth were largerdue to the partial success i had i decided to purchase the smaller set of fangs and try againthese were not difficult to set and are the standard for a reason i tried the smaller fangs in the past, but they fit my teeth awkwardly, and these were far betterlove these i bought the small and classic sizes for comparison because that what i do sometimes psmallpro the smaller size is more subtle they are great for everyday use are supper cute they are not as white as others easy to follow the instructions, but you need to follow the instructionscon the part of the teeth that covers the real teeth height doesnt cover the whole tooth, but when i smiletalk you cant see that part the selfadhesive material only works the st time but its what makes the teeth fitmold to your teethother i wanted the teeth to look more ""natural"", so, i i took my handydandy nail file and got to work i filed the top of the teeth to match the shape of my natural gumline i also filed down part of the thickness of the front of the teeth to blend a little better across the front of the teeth this did take off the coating of the teeth, but that helped with the next part i put the teeth in coffee for about minuets to tint them closer to my teeth and rinsed it looked like they were going to be too dark until i rinsed them, then they were great i use fixodent ultra and these stay in a good hours i can even eat fingerfood with them in, too after some practice if you use denture adhesive, wipe away the extra after following the instructions i use a wet toothbrush to go over the area to get any i cant see otherwise you will get dry mouth from the adhesiveclassicpros the part that covers the teeth actually covers the real tooth up to the gumline noticeable length cant miss it when i put these in not as white as other brands the ""custom"" material is easy to use if you read follow the instructionscons the length makes everyday wear difficult great for a costume or shortterm wear only selfadhesive the first time, but it material helps make them fit your teeth customother i wanted the teeth to look more ""natural"" so, i did the same thing to these as i did with the size smalls took a nail file and got to work then followed up with the coffee i wanted to drinkgripes wouldnt fit over my canines left fang stabbing into my gums when fitting the right incisorfull experiencethese look amazing so naturali did have to go to their youtube to watch the video they link from yrs ago on how to prep apply, but it was simple to followill admit i looked like a doofus wearing these on my incisors for bipoc vamp day the shorter style wasnt available when i purchased the classics wouldnt work for my canines my canines arent very pointy, but i guess they arent flat enough in the back like my incisors ill try again will only update if it works out so, if i dont update then it still didnt work for methe fang for my right incisor was stabbing into my gums when fitting no matter how i shifted it didnt take as well due to me shifting to find a comfortable position as the glue was setting the hold isnt as firm slips a bit easily, but i can still reuse it the left set perfectlythey do look really good pretty natural i just wish i couldve worn them on my canines the incisors just didnt work well for my look unless i hit the right anglestheyre pricey, but the quality fact that theyre reusable makes up for it id still feel comfortable recommendinglove these teeth theyre pretty simple to apply, only thing is that i, ironically, have very sharp pointy canines but these arent really designed for teeth shaped like that, you can make them work but i personally thought itd be easier to fit them to the teeth either side of my front ones as seen in photos they still look pretty cool and theyre really easy to put on and take off once the gel hardens they really are just the perfect finishing touch to my costume, and ill have them for all other cosplay related ventures in the future too, which is awesome before i attempted to use these i watched the youtube presentation as recommended all worked exactly as described waited minutes after setting the second fang then removed them tried them on again and there is no mechanism to keep them on push them onto your teeth and they just fall off useful if you need to take a mould of your canine tooth otherwise absolutely uselessfirstly check them out on me h t t p b i t l y u m z j x obviously remove the spaces pthey are outstanding great product, look natural, feel comfortable, easy to apply and fit, stayed in all night, easy to talk and drink although advised not to drink just incase but it didnt stop me getting smashed p and easy to removethey look even better with blood dripping from them psuper product, super fast delivery thanks d xthese are awesome, a bit wired putting them in the the cement and all but once they are in and stuck which is a task they really finished if the look, panicked a bit trying to get them off especially when intoxicated just nite down on them and the cement comes loose do not try to break them off nor bend themhad no problem with sizing my only issue was i was rushed in making up the glue and applying the fangs i did not leave long enough so needed to reapply my only advice is read the instructions carefully and thoroughly the look of the fangs is awesome so much better that the cheapy kids hinged ones the colour match was perfect too"

producti will be returning mine, if youre into the size of it, then good on ya i got it with the intention of using it with a pint glass and a strainer those straining lids arent my cup of tea and the thing practically envelopes the entire pint glass im a tall male with average sized hands, and holding this thing for a shake is just not going to happenmy daughter was looking for a mixing shaker to make bubble teawhen we searched online most of the shakers that we saw were made of cheap plastic not great for mixing hot tea and cold ice many of the other mixers were primarily metal cups again, not great for hot drinks we also found that many of the reviews on these mixers commented on the fact that they either leaked profusely or created a vacuum seal that made the lids hard to open when mixing hot liquids with icethe stock harbor stainless steel double wall cocktail shaker solves all of these problems the shaker looks great and is very well made the double wall cup allows you to mix both hot and cold liquids without burning or freezing your hands the shaker cap allows you to put enough pressure on the top so that there are no leaks make sure that you press it hard while shaking to prevent small leaks, while still easily coming off with no vapor lock issues once you are done mixing the caps built in strainer holds any ice back as you pour the liquid out of the mixing shaker the cup also comes with a leak proof drinking lid that makes it easy to take with you if you want to do that toowe spent a lot of time looking at the mixing shakers that were available on the market probably too much time to be honest the stock harbor shaker was by far the best design that we found and its worked great for every drink concoction that weve made my daughter and i highly recommend itfirst question is leakproof thats a part answer when shaking yes, it works well but then it gets dicey the ""jigger"" is the cap to the shaker there is no seal it is metal on metal which means you must physically hold the cap against the shaker while shaking no, not hard to do but a bit inconvenient then, when you take the cap off to pour there is some gin or trapped between the strainer built into the removable top of the shaker and the cap if you let it sit for seconds it will drain out it would be better to have the strainer as an option because they simply dont work as well as a strainer from your bar they hold the crushed ice and clog up and you end up making a mess trying to get the holes cleared shaking and pouring therefore i remove the top and cap together as a unit have to hold them together and pour out the shaker through my own strainer which is faster and easier shaker is extremely well insulated and a perfect surface that is easy to grip and comfortable to the touch jigger cap frosts over nicely to give an indication of how cold your mix has becomethe cup part itself is thermos type material, to keep the liquid cold the exterior finish has a nice feel to itand after initially being disappointed that the measurements were inon the shaker itself, i was very pleased to see that it looks like a travel coffee cup and the travel top is quite spill proof i have hidden the travel top so no one steals it and i lose my shaker set so dont ask me what im drinking keep walking, dont judge methe shaker top fits snugly and there is a very small metal cup that seals the top it doubles as a shot measurement and the only con is that the metal top cup isnt as snug as id like, when you take that small top cup off, there is a tiny bit of spillage but overall, totally worth itwe made cocktails late the first evening we had the stock harbor shaker the ice inside was still unmelted the next morning no more cold hands while making a cocktail, plus the togo cover makes this a star purchase love that the logo placements are subtle and the whole device is a very classy brushed metal its also bigger than most shakers ive seenthe main lid with the strainer has a great vacuum seal, but the top jiggerlid fits very loosely luckily we figured this out while cleaning it first instead of while trying to mix a drinkwish it was dishwasher safe, but i undrestand it not being sosee photo of the box side listening closely to our customers there are a lot of reviews that mention leaks we will be looking for improvements temporary fix wide rubber band around the top sealed itplus insulated, sipping cap made in the us of aminus leaks, as others have mentioned must be losing sales from that fix it and it will be starslove everything about this mixer except the top cap it fits loosely over the strainer cap and must hold well when shaking after shaking some of the mix or large drops will always run down the container side when you remove the top cap so i always keep a towel handy not sure if this was a flaw in mine or if all have this problem have not heard anyone else complain about this other than the cap issue i have, this is the perfect mixer"

standard on every one of these thingsthe handle is worth special attention a lot of infusers have handles that arent particularly comfortable to hold, and the ergonomic grip on this is a definite

liquid get stuck in the bottom tilting it can help it along its a very minor complaint, however, and its not unique to this model eitherit was the best of times, it was the worst of times our story begins in summer , which is when our main character, henceforth known as downstairs neighbor dn makes his existence known to us after i come back from a longish summer vacation, dn feels compelled to inform the building manager of my existence, including hearing my footsteps listen, i walk with purpose, but i am no stampy and you would think that someone that chooses to live below someone would anticipate hearing them, i dont know, breathe occasionally after building manager relays this message, i feel bad for being a nuisance and try to be more quiet soon i realize that im not the problem its the dn his actions include calling the police on a crew that the building hired to replace the building roof, which was as noisy as youd expect it to be but calling the police on the crew is not the solution the foreman dropped by to ask me if i was okay with the noise and told me about him calling the police dn also has not one but two disabled parking spots he lives alone but regularly parks in one of the regular spots when his disabled parking spots are sitting open my building doesnt have assigned parking but its also not like ample a couple of summers ago, i decide to have a summer garden and at some point while watering my one and a half springs of parsley and half cucumber plants, i do so while hes outside and water drops land in his vicinity heavens naturally, management gets a phone call about this they ask me to go down and apologize to him and i refuse because this is how of horror movies start instead, i write dn a note and ask management to pass along so at this point we are all on the same page that he hates me and i hate him, right okay fast forward to new years day on i wake up at am from a really loud banging noise i assume the next door neighbors who like to get it on at am and have woken me up so many times that i have started wearing foam earplugs to bed are at it again i ignore it and try to go back to sleep the banging happens on and off one example was at am after i went to sleep at am after traveling literally all day at some point, i cant take it any more and ask the management to talk to the next door neighbors to cool it except plot twist its not next door neighbors its dn who apparently told management that since they are not doing anything to fix the ""problem"" he was going to take things into his own hands the problem me showering ""late"" as in, showering around midnight after traveling all day long because come on you have to shower if youve been traveling for hours so we learn that dn literally throws his shoes or other objects at his own ceiling whenever i dare to deviate from his rulebook of my behavior at this point im willing to put up with it, just give me a copy of the rulebook currently we are at an impasse where i dont shower after pm and dont report it to the management when he is blocking in cars by parking cars on the driveway and he doesnt toss his belongings at the ceilingfast forward to today im expecting the delivery of this wonderful item which i expect the post office will leave in front of my doorstep except no amazon is delivering it naturally, they email me approximately times and even call me once telling me that they cannot find a ""secure"" location to leave the package i provide instructions to leave on the porch hoping theyll just leave it in front of my door but they refuse i ask them to take it to management office they refuse after approximately attempted deliveries between and , i finally get a notice that its been delivered hallelujah there is even a picture to prove that the package was left in front of my door except thats not my door and i dont know whose door it is before running around all around the building looking for my package and have to field questions from neighbors about what exactly i am up to, i go to the management office and ask them if they can id the doorreader, its the dns door which of course you probably guessed at this point management calls dn and asks if theyve seen a package not only have they seen and brought in the package, they have also opened it and decided that theyre not into tea as much as i am the package, now opened, eventually makes its way to my door and me and my newfound tea obsession live happily ever afterthe teapot itself is greatim a big tea drinker and this was a less expensive way to make my loose leaf teas i absolutely love it, it is a bit hard to clean the screen out but if you rinse it enough it will come clean just fine super cool fits on all my mugslove loose leaf tea and cant live without this brew mug it makes the perfect cup every time easily to use and clean last a long time kid and mesh filter are removablei like this because it brews a good amount of tea, is easy to use, and easy to keep clean i ordered tea at a coffee shop and they prepared the tea with the ingenuitea maker and i immediately ordered my own love iti use this to microwave water, then add any desired teaworks with tea bags as well as loose tea great gift idea for meit works as described hasnt leaked plunger at bottom dependable so farthis is a great invention however after using a couple times, the main part slightly changed shape so that the lid no longer forms a tight seal still love it easy to clean and use wish it hadnt warpedsaw this and, always a sucker for a gadget, thought id give it a go it makes a good brew and the transparent body really lets you see how the strength is coming along the filter does catch all but the smallest of the leaves my only gripe and the reason for my less than stellar star rating is it leaks sometimes a droplet, sometimes a dribble, and sometimes a full on puddle ive taken to always using with a saucer as i was getting bored of wiping up the spillsreview updateim updating this review having now used it for a number of months its certainly not living up to its early promise and it rather disappointingwe drink various teas with it but more recently the taste of mint tea seems to have stuck to it regardless of cleaning furthermore, the base now leaks even when not in use if we dont drain all of the fluid from it whrn using, and then leave it on the side, when we return to it later there is always a puddle on the worktop underneath itweve since bought a more traditional brewing pot and we are having better resultsid only recommend this for occasional usemakes a nice cup of tea, simply put in the tea leaves, add water and let it brew then put it on your cup and the water flows in or hold over the cup and push the base up to let the water drain out just be careful that the cup is big enough for the water in the infuser if you put the infuser on the top as itll drain all the water out the filter can be pulled out, first time may feel like needs some effort, to make cleaning easier ive rated flavour in the review but to be honest thats down to the tea used, but didnt want to bring down the overall rating doesnt need to keep the tea warm for long, as only used for long enough to brew it then transfer to your cupsaw this being used at a tea shop i visited in london and knew i needed one in my life i was deciding between the ingenuitea and the t tea maker i decided to purchase this product instead it makes my life easier brewing loose teas, usually i struggle with tea infusers sitting in my mug and finding a plate to put the infuser once its done and of course some loose leafs falling into the bottom of the mug with the ingenuitea you add the tea leaves and hot water let it brew for the desired time then the magic happens just sit the tea infuser on any mug and the tea seeps through leaving crystal clear tea without any loose leaves sitting in your mug clean up is easy, just give it a rinse and use some liquid soap and let it air dry will be purchasing the bigger one to use at homethe photographs do not do this product justice the plastic is much like a crystal clear acrylic and looks more expensivethe functionality of the teapot is almost futuristic and is lot of fun to use it can be used with loose tea or tea bags i have also used it with ground coffee the filter is very finethe only minor problem is that there is always a single drip after pouring, which typically happens if you have sat it on a tablecloth without a small saucer under it apart from this i have had no other issues with it and use it most days guests and, in particular children, are usually intrigued by its operationto go with the ingenuitea i would recommend a clear cup or mug so that you can see when it is full without the risk of it over flowing"

would prefer to keep quick grabngo stuff like napkins and sanitizer in it but the amount of strength needed to pull it is not worth the trouble, so i just use the hidden compartment instead otherwise,

the product photos and product video, and i was pleased to find the product was as handsome and durable as i expected i did have trouble figuring out how to fit my first generation ipad pro in the

my back and doesnt slide around waay to expensive for what i got thoughgreat bag with many useful pockets and functionsi really like the size and designonly reason i purchase this bag is to carry my ipad pro and i shouldve read the reviews first before i purchase this it does not fit with any kind of case on it if you dont have any case, it does fit but inside compartment only covers of the device and rest is open and im afraid it may be scratched by other items i put in this bagi really want to keep this bag but im going to return this since it does not serve my purpose i hope niid makes the second version little bit bigger so that it will fit ipad pro with keyboard case securelyi bought this bag for the futuristic ergonomic design and was expecting quite a lot from the priceit

havent tried a lot of different insoles outside of a few dr scholls, timberland pros, and keen utility insoles with that being said i would put these superfiot copper insoles at the top of my list and keen utility as a solid second i spend anywhere from to hours on my feet from the moment i wake up until the moment i walk back into my house i work in a shipyard doing repairs and new construction of various vessels so i am always on the move through all sorts of terrain, walking across pipes, climbing and jumping off of uniteblocks, ladders, scaffolding, you name it my feet definitely take a pounding on the day to day i havent found a reason to not continue to buy these as they wear down from taking a beating id say they last around months before i have to replace them thats pretty normal for my work life hope this helpsmy foot doctor recommended superfeet inserts while i was waiting to have my foot surgery i have bought this kind and the black ones because they were labeled ""low"" for people with low arches they fit into my hiking boots and a few of my sneakers without having to trim them, and they are very reasonable in price i am a in a shoe and this is the size i purchased i havent had to to trim these at all i put them in my hiking boots today and walked hours, up and down the paths of the nc arboretum and my legs and feet felt fine, no tiredness or pain at all i recommend this product for a short term solution to foot problemsthis product offers great heel support i felt the difference the first try i put them on, they feel great i just wished the glue holding the insole and the plastic heel support was of better quality after transferring them from one pair of shoes to another a couple of times they became unglued they still work well, but it is a bummer having to line them up everything i use a different pair of shoesthe arch in these have way too much give compared to the black superfeet though the arch is higher, they give much more under pressure theyre supposed to be for people who have fallen arches i didnt expect that much givealso, the heel cup is very tall these would not fit in most of my ecco shoes even with removable insoles because of this had to keep them anyway because amazon wouldnt take a return had one pair of deep volume boots by seibel and they worked in that i used to use the black superfeet on top of the removable insoles that came with the bootsif your foot can handle the give, these may work for youi mostly wear ecco shoe styles that work well for people with low volume feet soft and bella, which may be why these didnt work with most of my shoesif you have flat feet or feet that fall and your arches are not very high, the black superfeet have a very low profile and work great i cant recommend the black enough though theres no padding in them some of us do better without padding padding aggravates my hypermobility and therefore my mortons neuromashope this proves useful to peopleas a long term sufferer with foot pain, these have been a blessed relief i was diagnosed with plantarfasciitis in both heels three years ago and as it didnt subside after a few months, and as the injections hadnt worked, i was told it was probably permanent it seemed i would have to put up with the paini have tried many, many so called cures, gels, insoles, pressure socks, and yes, even magnets before, none of them worked when i saw these advertised on amazon, i sent for them more in hope than expectationthey arrived the next day, i cut them to size as described and put them into my shoes in some of the writeups id seen they said it had taken a while for them to work, so i was expecting a slow leadin to any benefit for me they started working within half an hour first, i noticed my toes were not as painful as they usually were, a short while later i realised there was almost no pain in my heelsi almost didnt believe it, these insoles were actually workingif you have or know someone who has constant, long term foot pain, the these cost is but a small price to pay for any form of reliefa couple of observationsalthough the insoles do ease the pain considerably while standingwalking, the pain does seem to increase when you sit down and take the weight off your feet i dont know why, but for me it doesthe pain increases when i take the shoesinsoles off the pain calming effect only seems to work while you are wearing the insoles which is fair enough i suppose no one claimed a complete curethey worked for me and i will be purchasing more pairs, once i am certain they dont stop working before the twelve months they offer as a ""guide"" to how long they last hope this helpsthe biggest problem i found was because of the high heel due to an added sole underneath the copper sole meant that i could not keep my heel in the shoe and my foot slipped out so i now use them in my wellingtons and i have had to trim the toe end to get them to fit properly an expensive purchase and i cannot return them as i have cut themi have fused ankles and have several pairs of these insoles they are very supportive and great for helping with my walkingi have arthritic feet and knees i was

toys balls,"update ive now had this just over two years and it is finally starting to show some wear on the edges of the funnel that is normally folded into the bowl it still functions just fine, but there are a couple cracks at the edge i bought a second one earlier this year as a replacement but havent used it yet i decided, tonight, that id throw out the old one next trash night lol in my original review, i mentioned that i pick the dispenser up immediately after she finishes eating its been clear that she isnt going to massacre it, so im not as vigilant at picking it up sometimes, shell have it all day while im at work shell greet me at the door with it hanging from her mouth while her butt wiggles in greeting its quite the sight a bubbleheaded, wiggle buttlove this i havent found anything i like betteroriginal posti really love this treatfood dispenser my dog gulps her food and has some other behavioral issues a different treat dispenser was recommended by a trainer and i wasnt impressed with that one so i did some research and came across this one i already have the orbee diamond plate ball which my dog has been unable to destroy over several months and she destroys most balls within minutes already impressed with orbee, i decided to give this dispenser a shotbased on the reviews, i knew this could be destroyed as its not meant to be a chew toy generally, as soon as my dog is done eating, i remove the dispenser however, there have been several occasions where i havent done so, and she has not chewed it up i dont know why, but once she gets all the food from it, shes done with it and leaves it alone im not complaining because its too expensive to keep buying themthe first few tips of the dispenser will offer a rather generous payload, but i see that as a good thing as that initial success keeps her tryingeven when there are only one or two pieces of kibble to get out at the end because this is a soft material, it is flexible and provides some decent bounce its quite fun to watch her grip it in her teeth it looks like some bubblehead muzzle when she does this, lift her head, and slam it to the ground to bounce out the stubborn kibble at the end shes also discovered that if she gets on the sofa or bed, it drops farther and has more impact thereby dislodging any kibble that might get stuck in the tiny hole on the bottom its good fun to watch her antics and nice to know that she isnt gulping her food it normally takes her between minutes to get every last piece out versus the minutes when she inhales it out of a bowli mentioned the tiny hole at the bottom i was concerned that the smaller pieces of kibble would trickle out my dog eats blue buffalo with lifesource bits the bits are very tiny smaller than a pea and would easily fit through the small hole however, this does not appear to be the case generally, a larger kibble will get wedged in the hole and prevents the smaller one from getting out that way my dog gets to cups of food twice a day depending on her activity levels, and i have had no trouble fitting either of those quantities in the dispenser as i already mentioned, the first few rolls of the dispenser will eject a higher payload and the more food i put in, the higher the initial payoffsome reviewers have complained about the dispenser gathering a lot of carpet fuzz and dust bunnies this is true i run the dispenser through very hot water every other day after she eats in the morning and by her night time feeding, its dry then about twice a week, i add dish detergent and shake it up to clean it really wellfood is easy to put in this the plastic or whatever material it is is folded down in so its more of a halfmoon ball when its on the flat side, it challenges the dog to figure out how to roll it back to the bouncier, rounder side anyhow, the folded down part can be rolled out and functions as a tube through which i add the food then i just roll it back in on itself and voila minutes of food and funbecause of the material, this is quite a quiet dispenser which is nice when i have to feed the dog at in the morning and dont want to wake up the rest of the house i have tile, laminate flooring and carpeting, so she can transition amongst the three without any major noise differenceive had this for a couple months now, and she still loves it, and it is holding up quite well again, despite being a chewer, she seems to leave this alone once she gets the food out it appears im lucky in this"

hence the supplement i looked for a particular strength and a roundabout price range this is the first ive tired a beet root supplement and i have no complaints, thus far but then, i really dont know what to expect from it eitheri initially added an omega with coq, dha, epa, and lcarnitine fumarate formula to the supplements i take, then later this beet root product i added beet root because research has indicated that it dialates the blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and allowing for increased oxygen intake and an according boost in energy when exercising my blood pressure readings have been almost, but not quite, at the prehypertension leveli bicycle, and run on an elliptical after two months of omega plus one month of this beet root, im able to put forth an additional effort i am able to ride about faster on my bike, and run about faster on the elliptical i havent extended my bicycle rides, or run for longer periods on the elliptical im riding the same distance and running for the same time as before and im just as tired when my exercise is over but i am able to go about fastersometimes there is a ""placebo effect"" you think you should improve, so you do even though the supplement is worthless but having tried a different coq lcarnitine fumarate supplement recently that did absolutely nothing for me advertised as an energy booster, but i got zero boost i think i can identify whether this supplement truly makes a difference or is a waste of moneyi noticed an initial slight improvement with the omega about , then an additional slight improvement another when i added this beet root considering my recent experience with the other supplement that did nothing for me, i doubt im experiencing a ""placebo effect"" with what im taking nowso, i feel slightly, but noticeably, stronger since adding these supplements im purchasing this beet root supplement through amazons subscribe and save program im going to continue my subscriptionupdate, april , i had my first doctors appointment since adding this supplement doc took my bp, i asked what it was, and his response was ""excellent"", which is something i havent heard in years maybe this supplement gets some credit, maybe not, but what im doing is obviously working and im not going to change i will continue my subscriptionupdate , september , just came from my second doctors appointment i go every months bp again lowits been about months since i wrote my initial review i feel even stronger today the weather this summer was great for cycling, and that was of my exercise over the summer, i slowly increased the length and speed at which i ride today further and faster i also notice improved strength otherwise i mow my lawn push mower faster not having to refill the gas tank is proof if i go for a lunchtime walk with coworkers, when we hit a steep hill i notice my heart rate and breathing are less affected than they were before etcnote that i take other supplements a multivitamin, the abovementioned omega supplement, and others i watch what i eat as well i dont know how much credit this particular supplement should get overall i can tell you that the combination of diet, exercise, and supplements, including this supplement, works for methis will be my last update to this review unless i learn something negative about this supplement best of luck to you in reaching your health goalsbeen on blood pressure meds as long as i can remember, here lately ive had to monitor my blood pressure for weeks after getting enough in my system i can say my blood pressure went from ranging im now staying around definitely worth the buyi have been trying methodically to lower my blood pressure for the past months or so using various supplementsactually i have tried a dozen or more supplements including the ones listed in by robert kowalaski in his book i take my own blood pressure reading at the same time daily and add notes to a wonderful and funtouse blood pressure iphone app called codulis it is great for graphing results and gives stats including averages of bp readings over days, weeks, months, etc this is very important since blood pressure can vary over time i find a lot of people give recommendations based on a few readings which can be very misleading and inaccurate for the past or months i have watched my average blood pressure reading and mapped bp graph gradually and consistently slope downward my blood pressure average at the beginning months ago was a high systolic average of with diastolic of around with spikes of systolic or more at times my average systolic readings gradually started to go down monthly to , and now i have average systolic readings for the past month of for my routine, i take two of the olive leaf capsules by life extension, natures way beet root capsules x a day and i also take one cup of low sodium v juice with a very small amount of now potassium chloride about tsp i also try to practice deep breathing and walk a mile or more per day although i am adding other supplements and making some life style changes, i have concluded that the olive extract is a large factor in lowering my bp especially in conjunction with the beet root capsules i have yet to have any side effects from this regimen other than some loose stools on occasion by the way, olive oil has recently been isolated in the mediterranean diet as the ingredient responsible for the lower risk of strokes and cvd in those countries the primary mechanism is believed to be the blood pressure lowering ability of the oleuropein

flashlight in my bag, which was not really all that bright anymore, and it would time out go blankscreen after a few seconds found some better batteries and measured the ones i had tried, and they were at volts with decent batteries it seems to be reliable, giving the same voltage and current readings as my fluke that cost almost x as much the amp current scale overloads on a amp load, so you switch to the amp scale and it reads correctly i got it so my farmer friends can troubleshoot their electrical stuff mostly fans and pumps and timers and circuit breakers and heating elements and thermostats all stuff that was not designed to operate in an environment as damp as a greenhouse and i have high hopes that it will turn out to be just what they needed basically test is ""is there voltage on both sides of the line"" and test is ""if yes, is it drawing about the right current""i am not a fan of the tiny screw that holds the battery door in place, but i like the wasy the battery tray snaps into place i assume the screw will get replaced with some duct tape as part of the next battery change, after someone loses the screw arrived on time, no complaints from me on this

works, accuracy and features functionalityto clear up many questions any many incorrect answers the meter performs the following measurementsvoltage measured using supplied red black test leads ac volts from to vac range settings for ac volts mv, v, v, v, vdc volts yes it measures dc volts like for batteries to vdc range settings for dc volts mv, v, v, v, vcurrent measured in amperes using the integrated clamp measures ac current amps only does not measure dc currentfirst to measure ac current you must separate the neutral and hot typically neutral is the white and hot is black then open the clamp, place around either the hot or neutral wire, wont work if you place clamp around both wires together like around a lamp cord wire, you have to isolateseparate these wires in order to read ac current once clamp is around wire is inside clamp area wire, then close clamp wire should be loose inside clamp area there are many ways you can do this ""google"" how to use a clamp ac current

replacement happy with the whiteboardits perfect for the price but its dented the box has a damage i will keep itbought it for the office because it was bigger than the one we had and we all know bigger is betterit passed my ""no swear install test"", meaning cursing was at an absolute when i put it up super easy did need a friend to help keep it level while putting it up, but that makes sense because of the sizeno scratches or dings sturdy included hardware was fine win in my bookbought this for my th grade daughter for christmas and she loves it it is a bit awkward to install you definitely need people, but the result is well worth it it is a little tough to get the metal tray to slide on it seems to hang on the plastic at the beginning but persevere it will eventually squeeze past the difficult spot with a little wriggling and clearing of shaved plastic the magnets she uses on it have also been used on our fridge, and they dont seem to stick as tightly on the board, but they are certainly strong enough to hang papers and other light items my daughter uses it for homework, and has actually written out math problems on the board and then took pictures with her phone and sent them to her math teacher to show her work i leave notes for her on it, and she and her friends do artwork it really was well worth the i spent, which was way less than all the other boards out there it arrived on time and undamagedoriginally, i gave this product a poor review turns out there is a protective covering of clear plastic if you fail to remove this covering, the plastic will degrade after repeated usecleaning, giving the appearance of poor qualityi thought it was a plastic enamel, but i was mistaken over all, this is a decent board it came with a very small dent in the front, or i would have given a star ratingdamaged on arrivalas others have mentioned, the sheer size of this board makes it difficult to ship, and therefore more susceptible to abuse enroute the back side of my board is completely buckled from seam to seam, however it doesnt seem to affect the stability or evenness of the front side the wipeoff surface as i had no plans for mounting the defect doesnt matter all that muchthe magnetic surface is strong enough for my childs learning tools and the wipe off surface cleans easilyover all, i wish id purchased a product with zero flaws but appreciate that i only spent for a huge board delivered to my door the convenience of not having to wrangle this in and out of an suv is reason enough for me to recommend this product to otherslooks a good product with a good size originally i used board but changed to this size mounting method is poor compared with many other similar products it is not a one man job it used four standalone brackets, two each on top and the bottom to hold the board the measurement between the top and bottom brackets is h board height mm the brackets should come with a slot hole to allow for bigger variance normally, you can hold the board after setting up the top brackets but not this one all four brackets have to be in place and by using four self tap screws to hold the board very poor mounting design i will not buy if i know iti bought this whiteboard to do some planning and organize my life overall i can say this whiteboard is worth it if you are somewhat kf a handy manwoman the setup was a pain because the instructions are basically useless after that, it has been a very reliable and sturdy whiteboardpros erases really good, doesnt leave marks behind very strong and durable the included marker holder is decent its magnetic which is a big pluscons was not easy to set up the included screws could have been betteri still would recommend this to anyone who wants a decent boarddidnt ship for quite a while which bugged me it arrived with badly damaged packaging but thats not the sellers fault i also ship my items with purolator and they damage mine too there were no instructions which meant searching you tube for help from other manufacturers that bugged me too the item itself is fantastic and i would endorse it completely i use it for my woodshop and my daughter draws on it daily great productprice for size these are the best things going way cheaper than ones half the size at brick and mortar comes with hardware, and looks sharp and clean on the wallthis board is perfect probably the least expensive you will find anywhere for the size and featuresmagnetic, marker tray i use half for doing homework questionsbrainstorming and the other half for

beyond pleased its perfect it is supportive and firm, with just enough give to mold ever so to my person it is the difference between night and day for me without the proper support, discomfort begins within the hour and progresses from there i keep doans on my desk, if that tells you anything i have been sitting here for a while now, doing my thing, and i have no discomfort or pain this is such a huge thing for me, it truly is i have been through a number of chairs trying to find a proper work chair with proper support and that gets right expensive the chair i use now works, but the back was awful was awfulgreat job, fortem i will laud you copiously whenever appropriate, and perhaps even randomly despite what strange looks i might receivewow that a difference this makes on my computer chair after sitting for long periods, i can actually get up and walk and no be in pain on my lower backthis would probably work really well as a support for an office chair, but not for your car if your car seats are bucket shaped the position of the straps meant it was positioned several inches away from the the seat, plus the straps were also not long enough to go around my car seat i have a volkswagen gti, so not a very big carwas ready to return because it was defective read in reviews how it expanded opened up packaging and within minutes was perfect would definitely buy agaioni am very disappointed with this item, it is not fit for purpose, after being out of plastic bag for more than six hours it is as flat as a pancake absolutely no use at all for what it was sold for and also is different to the picture advertised on amazon would definitely not recommend it to anyonei needed this for my car unfortunately the elastic is too short and wouldnt fit around the seat, even though its shown on a car seat i dont have a big car so doubt it would fit any others i was going to send it back but hope to find another use for itgot one for one of the guys in the office he was so impressed with it that ive had to get one for another member of staff i have a suspicion im going to end up looking for a volume discountthe cushion is really comfortable on my back and was easy enough to clip around my chair it does seem to support my back more and my amount of back pains have reduced it has provided more support for my chair to keep my posture better more often, although i still find i slouch could be just my error otherwise i am very happy with this productthis is a brilliant product especially for anyone newly working from home i have had so much pain in my back and this product really reduces the discomfort i wish i had bought it earlier the best of any back support i have tried"

texted and emailed us during each step of the process to correct the issue today our rug arrived and to our delight, it is perfect thank you so muchi rated this rug a starit was just as it described, as far as the pile height and thicknessi love that it is americanmade i always try to either support local or americanmade when i canthe reason that i returned the rug was that the binding was not the same gray as the gray rugthe product description described the area rug as solid in colorthe product pictures also look like the gray binding and the gray rug are the same colorin my humble opinion, the two colors clash and make the rug look twotonedunfortunately, its not what i was looking for in an area rugits a shame i ordered the little size rug to make sure the color was rightim glad i did before ordering several in bigger sizesi hope the company fixes this detail, and i wish them the best i would totally return this item if it wasnt such a large piece unfortunately the color is much lighter than pictured, and it came with mancreases in it, i have to put boards all over it to try to iron out the creases and its very difficult this is a regretful purchasei now have of these i had the privilege of speaking with their office manager last week, and she confirmed for me that this rdparty seller is dedicated to the quality of its carpets that are made in north carolina, usa theyre beautiful and durable, and i like the fact that they dont slip as easily as others while, at the same time, theyre easy to move when i vacuum and mop theyre also a cinch to vacuum all of the colors

quality carpets that will last a long time and are easy to maintain kp harwellthis area rug is top notch quality and exactly what i was looking for bought in ivory color low soft pile easy to clean

worth the extra dollars and would gladly pay extra to buy more goods made here thanksthe color was just like the photo and it seems very durablethe instructions were not clear on how not to clean ie, do not machine wash the rug came apart literally in the washer my bad should have read the instructions more closely there was a clear implication to clean it by hand, but nothing specific ill know better next time i liked the rug it just was not as easy to clean as i assumed in fact, i bought another one, this time knowing not to machine wash caveat emptor and caveat lectorumthe rug has a lot of orange or red, but it totally clashed with my dark brown decor it also felt super cheap an the backing was crumbling off, i unrolled the rug and returned the next day not worth the costnice rug

for a case for my new kindle and finally settled on this one it is durable, sturdy, and i really like the color there are a lot of options for positioning the table for viewing and typing which is nice it does not cover the speakers at all, so when you prop it up to watch something the sound is fine here is my one issue when you want to watch something on the tablet and you want the speakers to be at the top so the sound is better, you have to fold the tablet into a position where the inside of the cover is face out on whatever surface you have the tablet on so, if i want to put my tablet on a surface that is a little dirty or sticky, the inside velvet surface will be sitting on it if you dont mind watching something with the speakers face down, where the sound will be slightly blocked, you will fold the tablet with the outside side protected surface of the tablet on the surface you have it resting on of course, this is not a problem at all if you are using earbuds because you wont be needing to use the speakers, which is what i do most of the time anyways so while it is an issue for me, it is only a small issue but i dont think this is the fault of the tablet case, it is due to the speakers being put on the wrong side of the tabletlooks like leather it looks really nice definitely recommendi was a little hesitant of getting this cover bc i was afraid the fire would flop around since the cover only connects to half the back but it surprisingly works really well and it seems like the cover is magnetized to the back when opened which helps hold it in place cover seems

leggot the gilding design, looks and feels goodthere is a cutout for the back camera when you open the lid all the way, sort of around folding it in a triangle, the way you would use it for the front camera on top to zoom, makes a big handle for taking back camera pics not that id ever take a pic w a fire tabletbeing able to have the camera on top for zoom is the reason i bought this cover, having the cover also open ""halfway"" w the buttons on top where they belong is also goodhas anybody asked amazon why they put the front camera on the wrong side well until they move it back where it belongs, probably in years for the next model, this is a good cover to getwhen i bought my new fire hd, i ordered the keyboard case with it, not realizing it would be heavy and not really convenient for streaming i had this timovo style case with my very first fire, so looked for that again this is a great case the magnets are so strong and secure that there is no concern about slipping when in the horizontal position for streaming and the cover holds tight to keep the tablet asleep securelythe graphic that i picked looks like the milky way galaxy is very cool the cover is quality vinyl and the felt liner is soft and appears sturdy highly recommend now i have this light weight cover for when i dont need the keyboard attachmenti bought this case as well as another brand that had good reviews this one was so much nicer it didnt feel like cheap plastic and was much better quality it was even stands well on a bed and the sleep function works as described ive had the amazon brand case previously for the fire hd , and this case is much nicer overallthe main draw back is the fact that this cover will not allow magnetic charging i knew this before i purchased and was drawn to the design and sturdiness but, if you are interested in desktop magnetic charging look around for another productthe amazon tablet is new so they case price cost around the case looks smart, professional and feels decent the camera hole is on the hard part of the case which hold the tablet, the outer material case doesnt have one it study and isnt easily pushed over depending on the flap setup i hope to take the tablet to work and will update about longevity of the case ive attached pictures hopefully it helpsthere is no hole in the case for the rear camera how can they advertise this as suitable for the item in questionbought for my mum for her new hd fire, had it sent direct to her address she says its a nice coloured case, however, was perplexed that it did not have a hole in the back for the camera possibly a faulty one sadly i cant send it back as in the meantime, my dad has now drilled a hole in the back of it so the camera can be used, of a sorts if you ignore the frayed edged frame to the photos cant wait to see iti thought at first this was quite expensive compared to others ive bought but i am genuinely not disappointed with the caseit is a great fit and good quality casearrived in good time too more than happy and would definitely recommendit fits the tablet well, provides good protection and is just what i needed"

the case, it would be another reason to be disappointed but if they did im sure i would have heard the sound coming from the other side of the tube, which i did not or maybe one of the speakers was

back panel combine to absorb impact and leave you with a suitcase always ready for the next adventure sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey",,359.95,only left in stock order soon,234,clothing shoes jewelry luggage travel gear luggage suitcases,"my wife suggested i get this because i routinely destroy carryonsive used it on about a dozen flights so far, in the hold and carryon, and i like it a lot its holding up well the fabric is tough and the roundedoff shape helps it survive in the holdsome things to note the compression panel really works well, significantly increases what you can pack this compensates for the fact that the large wheels and rounded shape means the internal volume is a little less than traditional rollerboardstyle bags the arrangement of internal pockets is different from standard carryons, so you may have to rethink your packing approach just a little in some ways its better, since its easy to separate clothes, shoes and toiletries from one another the rounded shape means you cant easily sit your laptop bag on top of it instead you use a little strap with a very strong metal hook to hang your laptop bag behind it you often see aircrew do this with their bags one unexpected benefit of this is that the bag balances perfectly when youre pulling it along i can pull it at a fast walking pace with one finger, and there is much less stress on the extended handle always the first thing to break on these bags the hard plastic wheels are a little noisy on surfaces like concrete, but they seem able to shake off significant punishment i have dragged them over all kinds of surfacesthis is a quality piece of luggagesleek, sturdy and rolls great it it is lightweight which makes it much easier to pull and lift when stowing in overhead carry on it is very well designed and can hold a surprising amount of clothing due to a very handy removable cover inside that locks down to compress clothing it has additional spacious compartments for shoes or other bulky items a family member has had the same thule luggage for years now, used on many extensive trips and its still in excellent shape highly recommendgreat functional design and very lightthis is my initial reaction i received the carry on but havent used it yetwhy did i buy this for the looks, i also picked up a matching thule laptop bagits expensive it is more durable than my year old american tourister carry on probably not but time will tell ive travelled around the world and coutless business trips with the american tourister carry on and it holds updoes it have more space no, it actually has about half the spaceis it better quality yes it is better quality but not worth more like is it a better design lots of effort was put into it but i dont think it is any more functional than the oneso why did i buy it lately i have been going on many day business trips and i wanted to look good at the airport lol honest truthi will update this after my next tripi couldnt get it apartthe bad the only thing i dont really like is the wheels, they are largewhich is good but they are made of a hard plastic and appear to be wearing pretty quickly relative to the rest of the bagthe good ive taken this thing to africa once and europe twice and it still looks greatexcept the wheelsdesign is great i find the organization to be excellent, you lose some space with the outside pocket on the lid but i think the compression board more than makes up for it if you pack light like i do, space is not an issue at allit looks nice i have the backpack from the subterra collection and have been complimented on both several timesfeels sturdy, the hardshell body and thick padded fabric makes it hold its shape wellthe handle with he flat profile makes stacking a backpackwith the appropriate strap or panel super easyi love this bag read the reviews before purchasing and took notice to those who mentioned they could not put as much in this carryon as others but i found that not to be a problem i was a person who didnt know how to pack a small bag i have travel weekly for a two month period i think this has been a great choicegreat luggage you will not be disappointedthis case is miles apart from every to carry on ive ever used mega stable wheels, tough as nails handle and zips that just scream ""do your worst toughguy""the inside is a tad smaller than all the cheap nasty cases ive had, but its padded, and the middle is the perfect place to put your laptop ipad in the board thats clamped downits like a ton of thought went into this and somebody just finally made something that isnt a kids toyperfect for work travel fits most airlines even flybe works very well with matched laptop bag join together nicely for easy movementtop quality i mean this little case

lower in calories than regular sugars, but contains the same sweetness it can be a great choice for using in foods and snacks, keto friendly foods or used in blood sugar support supplements convenient sugar replacement xylosweet can be be used as a substitute for baking sugar and most other common sweeteners and sugar alternatives without compromising taste or texture xylosweet is safe with a glycemic index of , as opposed to for most table sugars great taste unlike other sugar substitutes, xylitol has no aftertaste and can be used in most recipes that call for sugar in equal portions without making any additional adjustments usage when cooking, replace sugar with xylosweet in equal measurements xylosweet is heat stable for cooking and baking it mixes and dissolves like common

substitutes xylitol,"im not going to delve into the science of sugar alcohols because simply typing ""pharmaceutical grade xylitol"" into google will tell you all you need to know about the chemistry and uses of xylitolthis particular product is food grade, but ive also used pharmaceutical grade and as for taste, its the samewhats important that you understand is xylitol is, in fact, a sugar alcohol like all sugar alcohols there is a slight cooling affect, basically it has a very light minty affect not to be confused with minty taste on your tongue your tongue will feel like youve had a mildly cool mint lozenge after it passes through your mouth ie, sipping a beverage thats why mints leave your mouth cool long after youve consumed the candy does that mean youve had xylitol before if youve ever had trident gum or used act mouthwash, then yes for a list of all brands that contain xylitol, you can look to the ""preventive vet"" website for a fairly comprehensive list like most sugar alcohols, xylitol has a laxative affect if you need an example of what i mean by laxative affect, mosey on over to the famous ""haribo sugarfree gummy bears"" listing and enjoy reading the reviews while haribo uses a completely different sugar alcohol named maltitol note the last syllable ""tol"" in the word maltitol, xtlitol will basically have the same affect if you over do it that being said, i would not recommend using more than a tablespoon per serving, with limited servings per day, spread out with hours in between intervals, or you may suffer some unpleasant gastrointestinal consequences in other words, if you are a cookie monster with an insatiable sweet tooth, xylitol is not the solution to your sugar cravingsthis is why it is not safe for animalsit is not ""poison"" like antifreeze and if your lbs golden retriever licks your coffee cup hes no sooner going to drop dead than that time he ate a whole hershey bar regardless, dont give it to your animals because they will literally poop themselves sick if they have more than their body weight can handle its danger level is similar to aspartame, pure cocoa, grape seeds and other seedsfruit stones, raw onions, etc i doubt the same people villainizing xylitol as instant death for dogs refuse to buy chocolate, onions, grapes, avocados, socks andor plush toys if you know you know, or household cleaners so take those comments with a grain of salt the best practice is to keep this, any other sugar alcohol, and all foods that are not intended for your animals, in an animal proof container out of their reach i for one dont let my dachshunds rummage through the pantry and i have a lock on my trash can to keep the the australian shepherd out of it i also recommend that you take the same safety precautions if you have young children it is not calorie free it has half the calories of processed white sugar, but it has calories nonetheless but its perfectly fine in small amounts and will help reduce your calorie intake if used as intended it can have a small, but limited impact on blood sugar its not zero like erythritol, sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, or even monk fruit it has a glycemic index of , where as sugar ranks around if youre willing to pay for it, isomalt used in cake decorating because it can actually crystallize is a great alternative it has calories per gram, a glycemic index of , and a slightly less cooling affect than any of the other sugar alcoholmy ultimate advice is that you do your research beyond the amazon comment section before you ingest any ingredient that you are unfamiliar with"

jewelry luggage travel gear travel duffels,"ok, right off the bat, this bag is pretty freakin cool and works really well with a lot of space its a nice high quality fabric and comes with a little matching carrying case which was so nice to havethis bag pairs quite well with a rolling bag and specifically has a ""pocket"" intended to be used alongside a rolling luggagei know this because hindsight tells methis bag is intended as a pairing with a rolling bag, and i suspect that when designing the bag, they were thinking users wouldnt be strictly carrying this luggage i sadly dont own rolling luggageit is a fantastic piece of luggage i definitely got full use out of all pockets and features this bag offers, and was able to fit everything i wanted to bring plus a few more things because of how much space there is there is a shoe compartment that fit my socks and shoes i used the garment bag portion with hangers which has snaps at the bottom to hold the garment in place the small pockets on the inside of the bag fit some of my travelsized goods the side pockets had a location for my travel pen, and i put my emergency contact info there just in case i had enough space paired with a second bag for my entire trip, and this bag fit more of my larger itemsi really like this baghowever, having had to strictly carry this bag during my recent travel, without a rolling bag to pair alongside, i noticed the bag itself suffers some pain points the handles, while durable did fray during the trip, but after i got home i used my lighter to remove them without issue the zippers have a snapping functionality to ensure the bag doesnt open while traveling, but there were gaps very easily seen and potentially grabbed at where the zippers connected i personally didnt have any issues while traveling, but it did feel slightly uneasy in larger crowded areas the shoulder strap connectors attached to the bag and the strap itself are not set in place, which caused the connectors to twist and bunchup the strap at the connector point the was a annoying because the shoulder pad wouldnt sit properly and b concerned me about the straps longevity when stressedoverall, i will be using this bag again for many trips in the future i think its a fantastic idea and well executed for the most part i will be looking into getting a carryon rolling bag someday, that saidi recently got this bag because i needed to transport a suit and some dress shirts across the country for a friends wedding the bag is cleverly designed to be a garment bag but then can zip up partway into a duffel bag there are also numerous pockets for odds and ends, as well as a removable shoulder strapas a garment bag, it works okay you do have to carefully lay the items into the garment section, to minimize any creases and folds the bottom does not unzip all the way, so you cannot just lay down the clothes and then zip them back up you have to make sure that your clothing tucks in neatly, or it will crease i was able to easily fit a suit jacket, three pairs of slacks, and three dress shirts when i arrived at my destination, there were only minimal creases on a couple of the dress shirts and the slacks my hotel room had an iron so i could work those out, but it would have looked fine if i had left it alonewith the sides zipped up, it becomes a serviceable duffel bag, and i was able to fit four tshirts, three pairs of shorts, my toiletry kit, and a second pair of shoes there is also a side shoe pocketyou do have to zip the thing up carefully, i was worried about getting some of the bag folds or clothing caught in the zipper if any of the zippers get stuck or break, it very likely will make the bag difficult to use for its intended purpose that said, i feel it was a pretty good value for the money i spent i would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an inexpensive garment bagi have used a much larger garment bag for years but found it had torn and i needed a replacement in a hurry this bag arrived in just one day in a box which seemed too small, but what i didnt realize is that this bag can be folded to be very compact when empty and has ample room for two full suits, two dress shirts, two pairs of shoes and all of my accessories and travel toiletries i was even able to slide my laptop between the garment roll and the inner compartment construction seems satisfactory and i dont doubt that this bag will last for years if well cared for on arrival it was easy to hang my clothes which looked as good as fresh from the cleanersrecent trip out of state, and i saw a similar garment bag on instagram this item allowed me to hang some clothing i didnt want to wrinkle it then rolls up to become a duffle bag i was able to fit some folded shirts and a pair of shoes this garmentduffle hybrid had more pockets than i knew how to handle getting thru security was a breeze my goto travel bag going forwardnice bag, look forward to using it on the next trip already tried it out by putting in the suit, shoes, and other items to complete the wardrobe, and works great i ordered the black one however, for some reason i got the gray one however, due to it looks great decided to keepwent on a trip where i needed a suit, sports coat, pants and shirts there was a total of items when i got there the suits were fine slight wrinkle on the starched shirts, but it really worked my only problem was finding a hanger that was short enough to hold the clothing, but would fit snugly against the top of the bag i had a couple from an old suit bag so i used those if a couple were included that would be greatthe zippers required gentle use, but they all worked and were strong enough to make iti used it as my only bag for carry on on an international flight to attend a funeral the only reason i gave it a lower score for travel was the shoulder strap it needs a wider thicker strapi love to cruise but i hate having to pack a suit or a jacket for dinners also, the current state of air travel makes me hesitant to check luggage because the flights get changed and your checked bags dont make it to the destination when you do this is a great carryon for cruise and business travel i cut the hooks off rubber hangers and velcrod them to the suit loop so i could hang shirts, pants, and jackets it was the perfect upgradei used the bag pretty soon after getting it and was very pleased with the results i had a suit, shirt and my wifes long dress in the zip up section and they came out without any noticeable creases my shoes fitted nicely in the shoe sectionthere was still room to put other things in the bag, but i tried to not to go overboard so as not to risk creasing the main garmentsi would say that it is only for use as an overnight bag because of the limitations when you fill the zip section i will be using it again shortly and will be confident that the main clothes will be protected from creasingbought this last minute as i was travelling up to a weekend wedding by train and needed something for my suit, shoes, laptop and extras it did an amazing job it was heavy but only because i overloaded it it was strong and performed it job well if it had wheels i would have been set i highly recommend this bag and i will definitely be using it more often nowan ok solution to avoiding crumpled suits during travelling bag is ok quality and a little cheap looking but is very lightweight does a reasonable job of what its designed to doitems more or less wrinkle free, good quality would get another if the situation requiredgreat product thank you"

559,torro magnetic case compatible with ipad mini th gen genuine leather cover with multiple viewing angles wakesleep enabled black,torro,,,56.99,in stock,222,electronics computers accessories tablet accessories bags cases sleeves cases,"the cover adds extremely little weight or bulk to the svelte naked ipad mini and it makes the ipad easier to holdgrab because of the magnet connection to adhere the ipad to the cover which is plenty strong no issues there, all the function buttons and fingerprint sensor are properly exposed the flap covering the pencil is ideal and that flap folds back flat and is secured magnetically when you have the front cover folded back it is pebbly finished leather but that is indistinguishable from ""real pu leather"" what an oxymoronvery minimalistic, adds very little weight and thickness to the ipadjust got mine a few hours ago, coming from the apple version i love the leather, looks and feels great i also appreciate how they put magnets where the latch closes, so it locks in place with or without the apple pencil its all about the details my only worry is the magnets i read all the reviews saying they were weak but decided to send it anyways they are not as bad as some of the reviews made it seem, though compared to the apple one you can definitely notice a difference just means you have to be careful with your device, as you should already be doing dont trust the magnets to save your device wouldnt trust the apple one like that either solid product wish they had it with the red stitching like the other model, but the black is clean give it a try if youre willing to be careful with your device will update if magnets lose any noticeable strength over timethe magnets work perfectly, been using it for almost a month now, and my ipad had never fallen off or slid out of place i am not super satisfied with the leather tho, as it feels a bit too rough to the touch, plasticky even it does look and smells like real leather, i guess, but the quality of said leather doesnt strike me as a superquality oneup side is nice quality casecand good power shut offa bit pricey but its leather and looks good hey, still cheaper than apple with quality fit and finishfine leather construction with an opensided design for maximum access to flush mounted top buttons unlike earlier designs that had a retaining surround with access holes, this case relies on weak magnets embedded in the back to secure the ipad its fairly easy to dislodge the ipad if youre careless otherwise a thin, light weight leather case that should hold up welli like that it is very purpose built it does a great job of protecting the ipad while at the same time staying out of the way and unobtrusive the trifold design of the cover does a great job at doubling as a stand i use the ipad mainly as a source of music for headphone listeningthe overall quality of the look and feel of this case is wonderful it is a small footprint, with no extra bulk and it is sleek and easy to hold the magnetic closure keeps everything secure regarding the ""hold"" of the magnet i agree with many of the other reviews in that it just doesnt hold very well every time i open the magnetic flap closure and go to open the front cover, the back cover peels off instead also, when i am using the ipad and i hold it vertical, it sometimes just falls off the magnetic back i love the design, so i am living with it, but maybe not much longer wish they would fix thishaving tried some cheaper cases, the torro feels superior in its function and quality both the front and rear of the ipad is nicely protected, with the magnetic case holding the pad nicely in position however, when opening the case you need to be sure you open the case cover and dont grip the ipad otherwise the case will break freethe magnets are sturdy once the ipad is seated the overall quality of the case is excellent with a magnetic flap ensuring the case remains closed when not in useto improve id suggest corner protection could be incorporated, this would also ensure you dont accidentally detach the ipad from the case when openingto conclude, id highly recommend this case, cheaper options just feel inferior while the official apple case is simply too expensivethis is a very nice, sleek, good quality case for ipad pro it would not prevent an accident if the ipad was to fall on a concrete floor, but it certainly provides a good overall protection from scratches, and does the job of a good folio case, ie standits made of real, good quality leather, its super light, and uses magnets to stick to the back of the ipad, leaving every side of the tablet completely free which i lovethe case securely folds round my ipad mini, the magnets holding it firmly in place good quality, and works well, the only concerns i have are that you have to ensure the device is fitted correctly otherwise it can slip out of the bottom of the case only purchased the case this week, so will see how it goesoverall well made but be aware your ipad mini can fall out when you open up not every time but doesnt always hold in case securely normally all of the torro products i have had have been excellent this looks the part butlove it originally got a cheap cover which didnt sit right with how lovely my ipad is so got this worth it and is sturdy and safe feels great to touch and a fab compliment to my new mini very happy with my purchase"

use, and ive owned or still own well over a dozen, from kinesis to ergodox to homebuilt to microsoft to you name it i was looking for a thin split keyboard to make a portable ergonomic rig for travelthis keyboard fits the bill as it is very slim in spite of the thinness, the key travel is significant and feels very good theres no wobble in the keys if youre familiar with dell xps, macbook pro and , and modern thinkpad laptops, this feels most like a thinkpad x or t keyboard solid and comfortablea nice surprise was that the casing is made of brushed metal, not plastic, it feels very durable and doesnt move around on a deskthe one think i would change is the enter key, which is like a very skinny iso enter, and the placement of and its easy to hit those keys when youre trying to hit enter and shift it takes some getting used to the key is on the right half, which is standard if youve learned to type with the right hand, but may be surprising to some as many splits have the on the left halfthe halves connect with a microusb to microusb cable, and two are included in case you lose or break one or want to connect the ergoguys numpad which canbe connected on either side, a nice touch for lefties a standard otg cable also worksall in all, this is one of the better split keyboards ive used, with exceptional quality construction and key feel, and a uniquely slim design that makes it very portable im taking one star off for the three key placement issues above but the rest of the keyboard makes up for it this is the best portable solution ive found so far its compact enough theres no reason to travel without a split keyboard and endure pain from typing on a standard laptop that alone is well worth the learning curve, and the keyboard pays for itself as it saves me from having to see an occupational therapist or of take time off work because of rsihighly recommendedi was very excited to get this keyboard it is very sharp and cool looking but it doesnt quite meet my expectations of a keyboard that cost this much money heres why when you use the shift keys, you have to use the shift key that is on the same side of the keyboard if you want to hold shift on the left side and then press keys on the right side of the keyboard, it doesnt work this is very inconvenient you have to hit the keys harder than what i am used to so that the keystroke is registered not a deal breaker the keyboard uses a rubberlike material around the keys and the rest of the top of the keyboard this material shows dirt and oils from your fingers very quickly after my first day of use, my keyboard looked gross i am basically having to clean it daily maybe i should be cleaning my keyboard daily anyway, but ive never seen a keyboard appear this dirty so quickly sometimes the keyboard jus stops working to fix this, just unplug and plug it back in and it works not sure if its my computer or the keyboard itself im using a macbook pro this was the keyboard really loved its compactness yet enough place for my fingers to roam, silent as it could be , perfect height for my palm pads, delete is separte key from backup and placed where it should be escape button placed exactly where it shpuld be very ergonomicthen why starscause they messed up with the two most used keys placement for absolutely no reason the enter key must be above the shift key in horizontal size they could just leave the pipe and slash button above the enter key as is the pattern everytime i went to hit wnter it just gave me a slash and when you are to write a k words essay it is frustrating same on the left side i dont need two pipe and slash buttons it messes up the shift keys placement and typing this is the biggest issue and i was tempted tomjust guve star but it is a very good product otherwise if they fix this ill buy it again in a an instantthis is just very close to the perfect keyboard for me i love the simplicity of the design and the split as far as i can tell, its the best design on the market for a compact, lowprofile butterflyswitch split keyboard the keys are comfy with very quick action and low noise despite a very clear actuation feelreliabilityi bought two the first had a sticky o key, and the second only lasted a few months before it started malfunctioning every once in a while multiple times a day, the right side would stop working generally i had to unplug the right from the left and replug it and it would start working again, but eventually i couldnt get it to start working againkey placement issuesi agree with some of the key placement issues raised by others, in particular the outdated vertical enter key horizontal is better and more common in the us i contacted their product department and they said this is because they share the mold with other international layouts that dont have the horizontal enteri also dislike the fact that num lock is shared between this and my key it means whenever i want to use my key for entering numbers, the keyboard becomes useless because much of the right side starts typing numbers instead of lettersthe switches are pretty good for scissors and the metal frame makes it feel high quality the layout is questionable though, especially the left shift key for mepro quality material metal frame makes it feel high quality good scissor switches they are crips and responsive thin profile is a pro imocons questionable layout why is there a key between the left shift and z price is on the high side micro usb is minor, but it should be usbc for the price not sure because i only use it for a few minutes but i dont think it had legs to tilt it this could be an issue for some usersa coworker recommended getting a split keyboard after i mentioned having neck pains, but i didnt want a mechanical keyboard this was the closest i could find to the apple keyboards i was already using i bought the us model as its closer to the apple uk layout it does need a bit of extra setup on a mac, but the instructions for how to install and configure karabinerelements are clear and easy to follow, and it also lets you remap the keys to be more like the apple layout its a little stiffer than the keyboard it replaced, but i think thats to be expected given the old one was nearly ten years oldi do miss having a numeric keypad the rgo website lists one as an addon, but i havent seen it available anywhere i hope they release it soonoh, and ive only had it a few weeks, but i havent had a stiff neck since switching to this keyboard so, fingers crossed, its workingi bought this keyboard back in january and used it pretty often the keyboard itself is good for typing, however, the cabling is pretty faulty every time you move your keyboard it disconnects from the computer between each side after months the right side stopped working, i tried using different cabling as it has happened before, but this time it seems that the right side got faulty completed customer support neither is the best i do not recommend buying this productthat is all i can say, the microusb soldering is probably loose on the inside of the keyboard sometimes only the right side works, sometimes the whole keyboard doesnt work this started happening yesterdaydas rgo keyboard hat eine hervorragende haptik, der anschlag ist gut, die tastatur flach und eben hnlich meiner cherry g die teilung der tastatur ist gut gewhlt ich tippe normalerweise auch tasten links mit der rechten hand und umgekehrt das geht jetzt nicht mehr und trotzdem ich habe die teilung nicht als strend empfunden die hnde liegen ausgestreckt gerade ueber den tastenfeldern, je nach persnlicher vorliebe angeordnet das funktioniert gut die verarbeitung ist gut, die hlften passen genau zusammen die tastatur ist schwer genug, so da sie nicht aus versehen beim schreiben verrutschtallerdings gibt es einige punkte, mit denen ich nicht so gut zurechtkomme, die rechte hlfte der tastatur funktioniert nicht mit meinem aten csa kvmp switch anscheined ist das ein bekanntes problem, denn in der anleitung wird darauf hingewiesen, da die tastatur nicht an einem usb hub betrieben werden soll, sondern direkt am computer fr mich bedeutet es, da ich die tastatur nicht zum umschalten zwischen mehreren rechnern nutzten kann der auf der tastatur blau markierte zehnerblock funktioniert nicht die homeendpguppgdn tasten sind auf der linken seite oben untergebracht, und erfordern handgymnastik, denn dort ist auch die fn taste fuer kompliziertere manver, wie das markieren von text bis an den anfang, brauche ich dann shift, fn und home, alles auf der linken seite die tastatur ist kompakt, dh der pfeiltastenblock ist nicht mehr separat das ist schade, denn gerade beim arbeiten mit excel oder beim programmieren brauche ich die pfeiltasten und homeendpguppgdn stndig ich htte mir die pfeiltasten und homeendpguppgdn als abgesetzte tasten auf der rechten seite gewnschtfuer menschen, die viel text schreiben, und schreibmaschinentechnik beherrschen, einen versuch wert ich habe sie jedoch aus den genannten grnden zurckgegebenel teclado es malo, es solo un teclado partido por la mitad, asi que realmente ergonomico no es las teclas siguen en una hilera rigida, no se puede elevar un poco, no trae apoyo para las munyecas tiene algunas fallas de disenyo tambien la tecla del espacio del lado izquierdo esta mal ubicado para diestros, algunas combinaciones de teclas no salen facilmente es una loteria ver si el shift izquierdo va a funcionar o no con eso en mente, es una buena introduccion al teclado partido para dar el salto a un teclado verdaderamente ergonomico pero viendo que es carisimo el teclado, mejor ahorrar mas y comprar algun teclado mecanicoergonomico que sea mejor"

answer",385,327.3,in stock,553,industrial scientific material handling products drum pail handling equipment heaters,"excellent product imo we use this in an rv to heat a pound cylinder tank pressure per one of those cheap gauges that you screw into the tank outlet would register into the ""yellow"" area, indicating tank pressure was low after adding this blanket, pressure would bounce back into the ""green"" zone, just like a full tank on a hot day i know those gauges dont get a lot of respect, but its what i have, so im passing along the information on a cold night without the blanket and a partially empty tank, its likely that our rv furnace would have been starved for fuel after running for awhile, so it would probably have shut off before the rv got warm even though there was propane in the tank this blanket keeps the liquid warm enough to continue producing good pressure down to the end of the tank ive used it now through several months of the coldest parts of the winter, and have not had any issues with the blanket or with keeping the tank warm very happyi use this product as a companion to a mr heater propane space heater what attracted me to this product was, small propane tanks losing efficiency in extreme temperatures last winter, we had several episodes where the tank would freeze up, the regulator would seize, and our only choice was to bring the tank inside to warm it up so that we could use our mr heater heater weve had this thing since mid november last night was the first major test, with degree weather it worked flawlessly the blanket doesnt get so hot that you get scared to use it it just provides passive steady heat just enough to keep your tank unfrozen the price was also a major attraction typically these blankets cost hundreds of dollars more would recommend also, we bought a heavy duty extension cord to use this thing, but it turned out to be unneeded the cord is quite longfor the price i wouldve expected more performance the build quality is high and it fits the tanks well its just that if youre planning on using this to keep an lp tank warmish in a real winter below zero f its not gonna keep up it doesnt even keep the snow off itself at about f overall a good product if only it was powerful enough to keep up when you really need to keep the tank temp up for a heater maybe ill add more insulation and reevaluatei purchased this item to use with my infrared gill i recently bought from woot as ive always grilled yearround i knew that the new gill would probably not work when it got below f the lp would not vaporized fast enough to keep the grill going my first usage of the blanket was at an air temp of f, with all three burners going at full blast i had plenty of fuel with and ir temperature probe i measured a temp of around f on the top of the tank just above the blanketthe real test came about a week ago when the outside air temp had been below zero for a day or so when i went out to get the grill setup and to plug in the blanket the air temp was f fifteen to twenty minutes later i checked the tank temperature and was getting a reading of around f fired up the grill and let it heat up for minutes before putting on the meat, at that point the tank was reading in the low to mid s fneedless to say i am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to gill in the winter one thing of note the product photos show and somewhere in one of the comments the power cord was stated as being only two foot long the unit i received has a foot power cord, which is a good length much better then what i was expectingit helps to mitigate the issue, but i wouldnt say it solves the problem completely my tank still freezes up, it just takes longerive bought blankets like this for years from a number of suppliers in this particular order, i ordered two blankets one blanket performed beautifully the second blanket only got hot on the lower portion of the blanket i was concerned that maybe the external controllers were bad, so i switched them between the ""good"" blanket and the ""bad"" blanket but that didnt seem to be the issue my advice is this every make and model of these types of blankets seem to have a failure rate of about in my experience the good news on these is that they are inexpensive so if you need one that works, just buy two and you are more than likely covered why am i not more upset that theres a failure rate there is difficulty in manufacturing a flexible yet durable high powered heater these types of things like to be inflexible roof top ice melting wires also have this problem flexible heat tape for pipes also has this problem could they fix them sure, but not at the prices the market will accept and in reality, even if only half the blanket works, you will still get to the temperature you need it may just take a whilei used these for my food truck tanks and they keep my tanks from icing nothing worse then dealing with propane issues during a busy dinner rushthings i will say in the positive it did get warm, it was not hot, i would imagine you would not a really hot blanket for a propane tanki will say it warms, but i had a few problems i could not get the blanket tight on the tank, it just seemed too large although it got warm, it was not warm enough to keep the tank from frosting, it was f so i might have been asking too much from it the fact i could not seem to get it tight enough on the tank was probably a limiting factor, as there was small gaps between the tank and the blanket which meant i could not tighten it down well enough to actually have it make a huge impact i am not sure if it was just my particular unit that was too large or if they all come this waythis is the ""light"" version of the power blanket for bbq tanks it works well during spring, summer and early fall but cannot manage during the cold canadian winter below c i use it at my summer cabin mainly to keep the tank warm and enable me to use very drop of propane in the tank the warmed tank has better gaseous conditions for your bbq and makes the burners of your grill burn more evenly will recommend this as long as you understand the limitations in cold weather and by that i mean anything below freezing accompanied by wind, or anything below cwe live in quebec canada we have winter that uusaly goes to f and we have seen f so since we are using only propane for heating and did not knew that below the propane does not evaporate anymore we decided to buy a powerblanket for our lb tank in just to be safe last year we had a very long and cold winter we had a contract for propane that was per month for month based on our usage we did have a very cold winter that did reach quite a few to we renew our contract in august and to our surprise the contract for is now per month for month based on the usage colder winter with less usage we did not expexted to be that good, but it isi dont know if theyre all like the one i received but i had to install it on the opposite side of the heat blanket were the strap that holds it all together and now the straps are useless and name brand is directly on the propane tank so no advertising and this way it heats the tank and not the outdoors and installed this way it works good but had to use tie raps to hold it together someone screwed up the assembly linei run a food truck in calgary, my propane tanks "" lbs"" freeze up when it gets below zero i operate in the summer only and, i do a couple of event late fall, so im hoping this will solve my problem only tested it so fare, first event coming up soon will send a new review if it does not solve my problemif you live where the temperatures plummet below zero this blanket is a must if you own a propane fitted appliance and youre wondering why its not reaching g the proper temperature well the pressure drops in the tank do to the cold by placing the warming blanket on the propane tank has resolved my heat issues having said all of my findings, one of the my observations is that you need to give the blanket some time to heat up the tank before you see results"

sure i can say about it i love it i love it despite the fact that fdm printing is not in itself a beginners hobby let me tell you, i went through a massive learning curve and spent some extra money on this little printer only to find out i really didnt need to have done all that but it works it works and happens to give me less printing problems out of my two the other works too but so far i find my self troubleshooting that one more often than this one short story is i love it, i find it worth it, and i would buy it again if i wasnt interested in the newer models i highly recommend it and i have recommended it to others who also love it if you are brave enough to continue reading, good lucklet me start with saying, out of the box installation isnt all that bad at first i was a little intimidated by what i was unboxing only to realize much later i didnt need to be so gentle with this device after much tinkering i eased off on how paranoid i was about breaking something installation was straight forward really i didnt find myself lost, but i have some years of experience with assembling stuff so who knows if that paid off it was once everything was setup that i found myself questioning life what the hell do i do now how do i tell this machine to print anythingwith a little reading i began to understand how to navigate the menu and use the microsd card to print models from except i only had the models provided by the product i was still lost on what to do outside of the sample stuff while the printer brought some sample pla filament, it wouldnt be enough to start my adventure with so i quickly purchased some creality brand name filament that seemed the same as the one provided as a sample i then proceeded to scavenge the internet for d models to print little did i know a slicer would be neededafter finding some d models online, i was faced with the realization, i cant just slap them into a microsd and print thats when i discovered what a d model slicer is after weeks of messing around with several different types of slicers i settled on the lesser advanced, and rather limited, creality print slicer software why you may ask because it does the job i need it to do and i have no need for all the other bells and whistles creality print is tailored to their creality product line and i can slap on modifications to my printer and the software has presets for them already so yeah, simplifies my life anyway, point is, once i began printing models on a regular i noticed an issue began to appeari would hear clicking and then the scratching sounds of gears slipping on the filament at this point i had no idea of what parts really did what and how so i had to analyze and figure out what the hell it could be this is where i learned what an extruder is and what function it has in the d printer what i didnt know, is all the other parts yet at that moment i was only learning what i needed to and not more beyond it so here i am, looking at this little electric servo motor and wondering what the hell is wrong with it it clicks, and sounds like garbage somehow though my prints were still finishing alright until it didnt, and i automatically assumed it was the extruder motor i immediately jumped on amazon and ordered a new one replacing it seemed to have fixed the issue at first but by the second day of printing all the familiar sounds returned including the failed prints so now im completely at a loss game over manthis is where i discovered the relatively cheap nature of d printer parts each part was within or less i bought that new motor for nothing, so im encouraged to really dive into all the parts i found extruder parts to swap out my oem one for an ""upgrade"" that ""guarantees"" the end of clicking and slipping was super happy with it honestly though if im honest i didnt catch myself when i made that change when i changed the extruder parts for the new ones i had also changed the bowden tube as well for those of you reading this far and have no idea what i just wrote neither did i until many weeks later the point is, when i swapped out the parts and changed the tube, everything worked like new better than new i was super happy, back printing nonstop until a few weeks later it happened again wait a minute guarantee no more clicking or slipping what the hell well, even worse this time around, filament was being pushed so hard into the bowden tube that at the entry of the bowden tube in the extruder the filament was being squished in so hard it clogged it it would clump into a ball of filament that was really packed in and hard to remove this happened several times before i grew so frustrated i swapped my extruder parts back to the original oem ones guess what it worked everything was back to normal and working weird a few days later again the extruder problem resurfaced by this point i had grown tired so i looked online for different types of extruders i then stubbled upon something that lit a fire of hobbyist delightcrealitys sprite, direct extruder this little device is an all in one hotend and extruder combo nicely designed to be slapped on your neighborhood friendly ender v wait ender v is this printer an ender v it has ender v in the name, does the neo really make it that much different oh well, lets just purchase it and find out later so i did, i ordered it and after a lot of trial and error found out it was not at all possible to slap on an ender v neo the cool sprite i had gone as far as buying parts for sensors to make the neo as close to the ender v version as possible in the end it would require significant custom firmware scripting and that pushed my limited time beyond what i could afford so the printer went back to oem and the bastard started printing just fine again what the hell what could be causing this weird on and off working and failingto my shame i found on amazon crealitys ender s cheaper than my v neo was when i bought it seeing as it offered everything i wanted to customize on my neo i purchased it no regrets love it too, but this is a story of the neo so after purchasing the s, i kind of noticed something about the neo i had totally ignored until that very moment a kind of breakthrough that should have happened the very first day the ender v neo has an external extruder with a bowden tube that feeds into the hotend why does that matter because it means the bowden tube gets as hot as whatever temps you use for printing my typical temps are in the c while the tube can handle those temperature, i did print nonstop everyday for long periods of time hell i even preheated my printer and forgot about it for hours at some points as it turns out, the bowden tube literally melts and reduces in size which adds friction to the filament and eventually acts as a clogged part it wasnt until i began printing on my new s printer did i notice this little detail after putting it to the test and changing the tube, printing continued without fail well ill be damned the bowden tube almost as if the universe wanted to slap me in the face i get an email from amazon showing me deals what do i see a product specially made for my printer called, spritewait a minute you may be asking didnt i already try installing the sprite before well, creality needs to learn how naming their products is very important the first sprite i wrote about here is in reference to the hotend and extruder in one package the same one you get with the ender s pro the sprite i am mentioning now, which is made specially for the neo printer, is only an extruder attachment that is placed above the hotend of the neo what it does, is eliminates the very long bowden tube and external extruder while it still uses a bowden tube it now uses a very short piece of it and in a straight line downwards, significantly reducing filament contact with the bowden tube not to mention the extruder is of higher quality with better gears and motor i also stopped preheating my printer to increase longevity of the bowden tube in short, that one, single upgrade changed the ender v neo to a beast of a printerwhile i admit to having made several changes i currently kept on it, the single most vital one has been the direct extruder if i were to list a second one, it is the improved springs and leveling wheels for the bed the original ones loosened very often and required leveling the bed manually often now i forget the bed can be leveled honestly, this printer is surprisingly good out of the box it only got better afterwards if you have any fdm printers with external extruders using bowden tubes, keep in mind the end of it goes into the hotend where temperatures will eventually damage the tube and require changing find good quality tubes that are highly resistant to temperatures and youll have long printing life i dont even suffer clogging of the nozzle the bowden tube really is my only maintenance now i have been trying to get my s to match the level of reliability i get out of the neo while the s works great, i find myself having print issues i dont get on the neo not to say the s is bad, just that i guess i havent yet adapted to it and im still learning to figure out what are its best settings all aroundi hope this long tale helps as i found myself making a lot of mistakes, buying parts i never needed, and missed vital clues that played major roles in productivity this is a great printer out of the box and a good cheap test bed for learning about d printing with a little extra cash you can further reduce its maintenance and routines to spend more time printing"

computers accessories laptop accessories bags cases sleeves hard shell cases,"i recently purchased the ibenzer plastic hard shell case for my macbook air retina display with touch id, and boy, what a ride it has been let me share my experience with this crystal black case that has left me torn between satisfaction and frustrationfirst off, the cases appearance is sleek and eyecatching the crystal black finish adds a touch of elegance to my macbook air, and the transparent design showcases the apple logo beautifully its definitely a headturner and has received many compliments from friends and colleaguesinstalling the case was a breeze the snapon design ensures a secure fit, providing protection for both the top and bottom of my laptop the precise cutouts allow for easy access to all ports and buttons, without compromising functionalityhowever, i encountered a minor setback when it came to heat dissipation after extended use, i noticed that my macbook air tended to get warmer than usual it seems the case doesnt allow for optimal airflow, which is disappointing considering its compatibility claimsthe case offers decent protection against scratches and scuffs my laptop has survived a few accidental bumps and drops without any damage however, i was disappointed to discover that the case itself is prone to scratches within a few weeks, it started to show visible signs of wear and tear, which detracted from its overall appealon the bright side, the ibenzer case is lightweight, adding minimal bulk to my macbook air its easy to slip into my bag without adding unnecessary weight, which is perfect for someone always on the gonow, lets talk about the funny mishap i experienced picture this im in a crowded coffee shop, trying to impress a potential client with my slick macbook air as i open my laptop, the case decides to pull off a magic trick and pop off the bottom shell talk about a showstopper moment luckily, i managed to snap it back into place, but it left me redfaced and laughingin conclusion, the ibenzer plastic hard shell case for the macbook air retina display with touch id has its pros and cons while it offers a stylish design, easy installation, and decent protection, it falls short in terms of heat dissipation and durability the lightweight nature is a plus, but the cases tendency to unexpectedly detach is an amusing yet inconvenient quirkin terms of value for money, the ibenzer plastic hard shell case offers an affordable option compared to some of the higherend macbook cases on the market while it may not have the same level of durability or premium features, it does get the job done for everyday useone thing i appreciated about the case is its ease of cleaning the plastic material makes it simple to wipe off any smudges or fingerprints that accumulate over time this is particularly useful for individuals who like to keep their macbook air looking pristinehowever, its worth noting that the crystal black color may show scratches more easily compared to other color options so, if youre someone who wants to maintain a flawless appearance, you might want to consider a different color or a different material altogetheranother aspect to consider is the availability of customer support ibenzer has a reputation for responsive customer service, which is always a plus if you encounter any issues or have questions about the product, you can expect prompt assistanceconsidering all these aspects, i rate the ibenzer case out of stars its a decent option for those seeking a visually appealing case with moderate protection, but be prepared for some drawbacks along the way"

the downside is that it makes a huge mess everywhere it also stains every single thing it touches and it is impossible not to get it somewhere on some thing we ended up having to go out side for the application process because it was so messy even being as careful as you possibly can you will inevitably drip sometouch some thing rub up against some thing somehow the stuff travels ill say its a good product it works, invest in a plastic cape maybe two one for yourself and one for whoevers hair youre putting it in some really good gloves some good ventilation make sure you dye the hair to lighter shade of blonde as you can get and pile my stuff on leave it on forever and prepare to scrub your shower down when you get outi bought red and blue and did half and half on my stepsons hair it turned out soo cool very vibrant, bright colors that last a long time he gets so many compliments on his hair out in public i highly recommend this productvibrant blue, sets in quickly to bleached hair love this colorvery easy to make touchups by hand with gloves on, as its viscous enough to manipulate easily like fingerpaintingive used manic panic for a long time the thing about the brand is that its not permanent but its one of the better semipermanent hair dyes out there thats not too expensivered colors will stick much better than blue colors which is why when hair dye fades your hair becomes brassy or even green yikes the red, yellow, and orange in the dyes linger the longestthe fade on this is pretty good i recommend mixing it with manic panics silver blue to help the fade be less brassy your fade will be more silver and less green that wayalways make sure you hair is freshly washed and not greasy or containing chemicals before applying this kind of dye i didnt wash my hair after swimming in a pool once and the leftover chlorine in my hair made the color wash out completely your hair needs to be clean and it needs to be dry no grease, no hairspray, no nothing wash your hair in the morning, let it dry, and then add the dye in the eveningif you dont bleach your hair, the dye will not stick as well even if you bleach your hair for just or minutes it makes the color stick better than putting it on your natural hair if you have a strict nobleach policy then i hope you at least have blonde hair because the color will look really gross otherwise brown just doesnt mix with vivid colors like this brown makes everything else brownleave the dye in your hair for longer than the recommended time i put a shower cap on and sleep in it, or leave it in for hours some people will say it doesnt matter as long as its over an hour i think it matters leave the dye in for at least hoursrinse your hair with cold water and do not wash with soap do not wash with soap when it comes time to rinse out this dye, if you use shampoo after applying it you will notice an immediate fade if you just rinse your hair with cold water until the color in the water fades to pretty much clear, then you will have washed all the dye residue off not washing your hair for at least hours after the initial rinse will help bind the color to your hair and make it fade slower dont skip this step seriously dont use shampoo or conditioner for hours after rinsing this dye out with cold waterspray in shampoo is your friendfor anyone coloring their hair using semipermanent dye, its going to fade and its going to fade in proportion to how much you wash your hair wash your colored hair in cold or cool water always tie it up and dont get it wet if you like hot showers turn the shower water cold or wash it in the sink i only wash my hair once a week ive trained my hair and now it only starts to get oily after about the th day of not washing it your color will stay vivid and you will need to buy less hair dye if you wash your hair less washing your hair every day is damaging to your scalp and hair anywaymix this dye with a red dye to get a longer lasting dark purple for some reason purple hair dye doesnt stick to save your life ive tried every type of manic panic purple and its gone after the third wash mix midnight blue with vampire red to get a lovely purple color you can add developer or your choice of conditioner to the mix in order to make the colors lighter red to blue ratio decides if the purple is more navy purple, plum, or magentafollow these rules and your color will last you a maximum of weeks before you have to reapply or touch up your rootsokay im writing this while my hair is still drying however i wanted a ombr type style because i wanted to do something that i had never done before i have dark brown hair so i ordered manic panic bleach which did a good job and then siren dye i used the entire container on my head and left it on for minutes after the , i rinsed it out with cold water like the reviews suggested as im looking at my hair, i notice that most of the color was rinsed out too my hair is sadly not at all as vibrant and lovely like the other reviews i definitely will be trying a different color because it looks more like i had color that faded over a long period of time i am not blaming the color or brand , as maybe it just doesnt take to hair like mine i will be trying a darker blue to see if that does a better job second time is a charm hopefully before this my hair was all pink, orange and blonde, all faded didnt want to dye my hair since im pregnant so i did most of my hair with this blue and my undercut purple the blue took but not to my dirty blonde roots definitely worth it oh and it also hasnt faded too too much and its been a month i hope that helps you allhad a vibrant color and has lasted several shampoo sessions application was easy and the color smells goodused it to make myself ginger spice mix with arctic foxs sunset orange and a purple totally recommend if you need a vibrant yellowha preso perfino sulle parti pi scure quando ho decolorato creando una bellissima sfumatura, molto resistente per essere un pigmento e attualmente ho questo colore dal gennaio ed ha schiarito solo sulle punte consiglio di applicare con dei guanti e proteggere la pelle con della vaselina perch macchia tantissimo e quando ci si lava di fare attenzione a non schizzare ovunque perch le macchie rimangono per un pochino inoltre lo consiglio anche a chi castano chiaro o biondo scuro per avere dei bellissimi riflessi rosamagenta i wouldve liked to give but this did not live up to expectations ive used manic panic purple haze before even that had its drawbacks and loved the pigmentation of that color this one was left on for almost an hour after checking the strands, i noticed it wasnt taking thats why some strands are lighter in the pic provided and i had to reapply and used heat how i was able to achieve that really nice vibrant green if you want that vibrant green, youll have to go against instructions to achieve so definitely not for a first time user or someone unfamiliar with coloring imoif your hair is light brown and you dont want to bleach it its the right colour for you rather than being the colour presented by the seller, which youre only gonna achieve with bleached hair, it gives you this nice imho tasteful denim blue, depending on the undertones in your hair it might be that the warmer the undertones, the more green hue youre gonna get as it washes out my hair has rather cold undertones i left the dye on for just over hours, as the strand test showed half an hour is just not enough it didnt damage my hair at all however please dont skip the part where it tells you to protect your hairline and neck with petroleum jelly or sudocrem in my case and wear gloves, because it stains a lot, and within seconds, and you dont want to look like papa smurf, do you i also wore a plastic bag over my shoulders for the initial rinse, to protect my arms from being blue, as im quite pale when it comes to staining the bathroom, i found using a regular shower cleaner removed it very easilynon so come sia da solo, io lho usato mixato con psychedelic sunset in parti uguali, larancione pi bello che abbia mai fatto e ne ho fatti tanti foto senza filtripenso sia utile lasciare questa recensione perch ho notato parecchia incertezza e confusione al riguardo la seconda volta che compro questo prodotto e ve lo consiglio assolutamente non fatevi spaventare dalle dimensioni del barattolo perch vi assicuro che vi dura un saccocome ora ve lo spiegodopo vari tentativi e ricerche ho capito come usare questa tinta al meglio vi baster infatti mettere in una ciotola di tinta e di balsamo lintensit e la durata la stessa ma non vi macchier i vestiti vi suggerisco di lavarvi i capelli, dopo aver lasciato in posa il prodotto, con i guanti cos da evitare qualsiasi macchia sulle mani per quanto riguarda la doccia o la vasca, io avendo una doccia vecchia so bene che un po di colore pu rimanere ma dopo un po va via senza problemi questo prodotto vi lascer i capelli morbidissimi e profumati, adatto anche a chi ha la cute pi sensibile e credo che sia una valida alternativa ai prodotti del supermercatospero che la mia recensione vi sia stata utile"

when i step on them lbs the passenger side fits up nice and the splash trim also, but the drivers side is something else the splash trim does not fit up correctly to the rocker causing a gap and it rattlesi found a phone number for westin and called them well after going over it i was ask to put it into an email written so they could work on it after being gone on vacation for weeks i seen no messages from them so contacted them again day return running out i was requested to send pictures of mounting and boards, so i did and after a week with no confirmation of receiving information or pictures i contacted them again now return period has expired i was told they customer service received the materials and sent it to the engineering department they westin engineering would contact me with a resolution or correction for this problem that was in may and it is now september and have heard or seen nothing from westinthe little woman is only "" and years young with spinal stenosis and the acadia sits fairly high up with the "" wheels so running boards are a necessity i not only have the expense of the mounting kit and boards, but i had a shop install them so i am invested about

up under the rocker to rot it out from the saltwestin is one of those manufacturers that likes your money but could care less about their products problems i would recommend buying from someone else unless you care less about bad products or have money to burn for new ones this all started the first part of may, and my last contact to westin as they have yet to contact me once though said they would was the end of may and they engineering were going to contact me now its september and nothing yet recommend avoiding westin productsreceived item and went to install on my gmc acadia i read instructions about times and still had trouble understanding them i downloaded better instructions from westin website matched all nuts and bolts except two weather strips they were not listed on the parts summary they were not listed on instructions where did they go on my vehicle played with several scenarios but nothing matched searched website for over three hours to find help and finally the instructions i needed turn step boards on top, locate tiny groove on vehicle side, remove one endcap unscrew one side screw and two tiny backside screws located close to end of step board slide weather strip inside small grove it will slide easy and take the entire weather strip, no trimming needed turn step board back over and mount to truckthe four black steel mounting brackets needed to be lettered or itemized the bracket with the large dip or cut out in it goes on pasenger rear have someone help you with these brackets it is difficult to hold bracket, and try to thread a flat washer, lock washer and nut over bolt while holding a steel bracket my wife was an unwilling volunteer but when she finally ran out of cuss words, i had my helperend results, the running boards look great i took me about hours total time you will save about over what a car dealer will charge you amazon had the best prices and very fast deliverythese look great on our grey suv and were fairly easy to put on for two people now i knew that from researching online and that a mounting kit was needed purchased separately the biggest get from these is my year old can finally get in the car without getting on her knees on the car floor to get in or sitting down on the floor to get out the harder part for adults and the reason for of stars, although not the products fault, per se is to get used to getting out and stepping further away from the car as these hit you in the calf area so for taller people it will just take some getting used to for shorter ones the added step may help so again, that is not a fault of the product but its the only feature keeping me from stars there is goodbad to getting running boards and that feature is not enought to outweigh the benefit for the kids and, to be honest, they look really good on the vehicle for far less than the toyota oem running boardsi got these running boards along with the required brackets from westin for my traverse installation was easy although the direction couldve been made simpler overall it only took me a hour or so and all i needed was a socket wrench and a mat to cover the garage floor since i dont have a lift it looks really nice and now my wife and son can actually get into the truck without needing climbing gear the rubberized step is great for when it rains there is a tiny bit of flex when i put my full lb frame on it but in reality ill probably not be using it, only the family i recommend iti added these running boards to my jeep to help my elderly parents get in and out of the vehicle it is working i took it to the dealer for installation and the technician gave me the thumbs up for choosing westinbought for a gmc acadia had some on my previous vehicle and tried finding similar ones in black

online that indicated womens shoes are sizes higher than mens why the heck this is, ill never know, so i took advantage of the new ""prime wardrobe"" feature more on this later to order two pairs of keens womens sandals to be on the safe side, i ordered one pair, womens size these, the ""crabapple model and another womens size the size sandals were only slightly too long and the size were slightly too narrow, so the conversion rule isnt perfect but only ""slightly"" off as i know these shoes stretch, slightly, with wear, i went with these shoes and returned the othersi love these sandalshoes by keen they are comfortable, colorful, and very well made i wear them year round, but they are particularly great in the summer because, like flipflops, they allow your feet to breathe and stay cool, but remain in place and present no problems in term of walking or running i already have three pairs and ive been on the lookout for more they are by no means as cheap as flipflops so i cant afford to indulge myself with other shades of blue, green, and brown and keen offer a wide variety of these shades plus other colors so ive been looking for distinctly different colors this figcrabapple model caught my eye because of the color which is a little more of an orange shade than the pinkish shown in the photo a good thing imo the problem was it is only offered in a womans model while there may be a difference in the design of keen mens sandals and their womens version, i cant detect it, so it really only came down to the sizing isnt perfect, but if they stretch only a little bit, it will be i dont foresee using my new found knowledge of shoe sizing to purchase a lot of womens shoes for myself for me, at least, its only applicable for shoes or sandals that are basically unisex to begin with and i think these keen sandals are just thata word on prime wardrobe i assume, by the name, that it is only available to prime members but if you shop with any regularity you really do need to become a member you will recoup the membership fee on shipping costs savings alone, plus you receive all sorts of great extras now prime wardrobe is one of them and it too is great briefly, you can order up to articles of clothing and have them shipped to you within a few days you pay zero , and this applies to shipping too after the items arrive, you have days to try them on for size, judge the colors and designs in the real world, and do just about anything else you might normally do when shopping in a bricks mortar retail store if you want to keep one, more or all of the items, you dont have to do anything although amazon requests you go to your online order and indicate your intent to keep them whenever you advise amazon you want to keep one or more items, or after seven days from receipt, you will be billed at the items price at the time of your original order if you decide not to keep something you simply return to the original order and indicate you are returning it doing so is a breeze the items are shipped to you with a prepaid return ups label and the box the items arrived in has a resealing sticker attached all you have to do reseal the box with the returns inside slap on the label and drop it off at your nearest ups store at no point is there any cost to youobviously the returned items cant be damaged or display obvious wear and you are supposed to return them in their original packing, but these are hardly unreasonable requirements this is my first use of the feature and so i cant report on whether or not the return smoothly finalizes, but ive no concern that it wont amazon may have thought, when putting this feature together, that some buyers will not get around to returning goods they dont really want and will end up paying for them, but i dont think its, at a major concept for them i know this is a motivation of other retail sites that offer this sort of ""test for free"" feature but the ones ive seen, charge your credit card upfront and issue a credit when the returned goods are received, andor make it unnecessarily difficult to return any items this is definitely not the case with amazon pretty

mobile workplace, i had joined the ranks of those with a solid laptop for sitting down and getting deeply into work, plus a smart phone for smaller stuff on the go that can be tackled without setting up the bigger space a laptop requires but, as awesome as smart phones are, i found myself frequently wishing i had something in between, for things i didnt really need to drag out the laptop for, but for which the smart phone wasnt quite enough for the task at hand, just due to the limitations of its sizeenter, the tablet while, for a time, i didnt get the idea of such devices, thinking it was just a way to play angry birds in more spectacular fashion, and found it actually rather laughable when someone held up a halfcookiesheet sized tablet to snap a photo of something, the purchase of my nexus converted me to embracing the ""tech trifecta"" of laptop, tablet, and smart phone i now have a bridge device perfectly suited to those jobs that are in between what is too much for my phone but which does not require the full resources of my laptopand, along with the solution, enter the problem, which is that, like other portable devices, for knocking out serious work few mobile machines including tablets have adequate keyboards or mouselike functions to expedite and makefriendly textbased tasks for my laptop, i solved the problem long ago by getting a full size external keyboard and mouse and even have an external monitor for when im really logging the hours for the phone, i did have a slider smart phone with a qwerty keyboard for as long as such phones were being made, but i finally had to give that up, once the phones with the most powerful and useful features for business or fun were eschewing ""outdated"" keyboard concepts in favor of total touch screen tech which became a greater limitation of phone use for work tasks, even more highlighting the need for a tabletbut, the tablet itself, i found, had the same limitation a stylus made navigation easier, but, in terms of heavy typing, although larger, the touchscreen keyboard was stilla touchscreen keyboard yes, virtual keyboards are getting better and better, but, still, for any real work, the tappity tap on a screen just doesnt cut it, at least not for me as a touch typist so, it seemed that perhaps my grand new bridge device was going to turn out to be a bridge too farenter the hero the microsoft wedge mobile keyboard this bluetooth device is a gem while small enough to be very portable, they have sized it just large enough to be wonderfully easy to type on, so much so that i now rely on it for any situation where i need to send a reply or create a document of more than a few lines it just, hands down, beats any touch screen keyboard, in my opinion, and frankly lays waste to many physical keyboards three times its sizeset up is a breeze pop off the sturdy top cover which doubles, for me, as a base to put my nexus on, when in its stand, to give it a perfect height for viewing, and it automatically powers on, and your device already knows its little keyboard buddy after youve completed the super short initial one time set up unless you need to repair it, but i will mention that later, and, wow, you are instantly typing away at your hearts contenti love that the cover doubles as a power off no worry about ever accidentally draining the two aaa batteries just put the cover back on, and the keyboard powers itself off i have yet to even change the batteries after steady use since i bought it, which is going on a few months nowfurther awesomeness is provided by the fact that the battery compartment beneath the keyboard itself doubles as a built in stand for what the keyboard rests on, putting it at a perfect typing anglefor typing, the keys are crisp and sure, very nicely spaced for such a compact device, and the layout is such that it is not the kind of keyboard design that is frustrating to use or prone to encourage typos with hardtohit keys typing is sure, quick and fluid there is no lag whatsoever from what you type to what appears as fast as you type itas if that wasnt enough, the coverlid is designed as an instant device stand just bend it to any angle you want and you can prop a device in it, voila pairing is quick and problem free at first setup at the end of battery compartment is the bluetooth discovery button, just press and hold and wait for your device to see the keyboard, type in the code it gives, and, as i say, you have an instant and very functional keyboard standing by for any amount of usei love it even more because of course, it connects to any bluetooth device, which meant that, just two days after getting it, being out in the field with my laptop, but with none of my ""make tasks friendlier"" laptop accessories, i realized my new keyboard was in my briefcase with my tablet, and, ta da, instead of using the lessthanconvenient laptop keyboard, i just paired the wedge keyboard to my laptop, and was off and runningeven more hilarious was pairing it to my smartphone, the next day, when i was without my laptop or tablet, and, instead of the tedious job of answering an email with the phones small touch keyboard, i paired up my wedge keyboard to save the daydrawbacks none, for me this is one of the best tech accessory products ive purchased you might find that it is not super light when packing it around with you but, i think youll appreciate, as i do, the solid and sturdy design a few extra ounces is worth the quality it exudeshow could it get better well, i think a new tech that is coming out, eventually, is the ability for one bluetooth device to ""remember"" all the devices it ""talks"" which would eliminate the need to unpair and repair the keyboard when switching from one device to another so, i can only say that a future improvement given that i now use it on three devices would be adding such a feature to it in future designs but, given that pairing from device to device takes just a few seconds, thats nitpicking, lol, and only speaks further to how great the keyboard is, given that i now want to use it on multiple devicesif mobility combined with functionality is your goal, the little workhorse takes the cakeoh and yes, i did type this using my trusty new wedge keyboard so, given thats this review is a bit long, you can thank or not thank, depending on your view of this review, lol my new typing ally for being so easy to use that you just can go on and on and on and onhighly recommend this great device update jan just wanted to add, nearly eight months have gone by with regular use on a periodic basis, and i still have not needed to change the batteries amazing love this keyboard"

a fridge at home it can take the inside from ambient temperature down to in mins, then to freezing temps of or below after another mins unlike electric coolers, the car freezer does not need to have its compressor running all the time either they simply stop once the desired temp is reached, then turns on again after a threshold temperature differential is surpassed electric cooler can cool down to , if it is not too hot outside this is why ice cubes cannot be placed in the electric cooler, because it is not a refrigerator, its cooling temperature is much higher than degrees , and ice cubes will melt quickly fan needs to constantly run to maintain temperature cannot set temperature its usually just cold or hot easier to carry around the park or beach for a picnic a car freezer tends to

could use it in the car and in the motel rooms and loved not fooling with heavy ice the side pockets are a great feature the only negative i can find is the plug in location at the bottom of the cooling uniti bought this a few days before a week long solo road trip its not a refrigerator but it keeps food drinks cool and fresh i put it on the floor of the passenger seat so i could easily reach things it came with dc cords that are long enough to run from a dc plug in the back seat up to the cooler in the front so i could use the front outlets for my phone, etc it ran quietly for long hours of driving it also comes with an ac outlet adaptor so i took it into my hotel rooms each night and plugged it in i was able to store sandwiches, leftovers from meals, water, sodas, snacks, etc in it for the entire trip with no issues i have been very happy with this itemthe zipper broke on the first day of our day drive luckily i could use the zipper on the other side to shut it completely also, be aware, the paperwork included says that it cools to degrees i want super computable keeping all the different foods at only degreesespecially meats somake sure your food is already chilled down or even frozen for our return trip of driving days, we added zip lock bags of ice to me, this defeats the purpose i wont be getting another one and can only recommend for shorter tripsthis certainly fit a lot of things in it but was very heavy when full i purchased an accessory plug to use it inside when going from the car kept everything temp controlledgive it as a gift to my friend who just got a new car, and we have been out several times using it i originally got it for cold beverages, and it works perfectly in that scenario it holds the temperature well, is waterproof, and is easy to clean any standard wine bottle can fit in it fine, and there is an inserted divider that can keep things in place and organizedbut i have to mention that we use it for takeouts in most cases besides keeping food hot, it also prevents the smell of food leak into the car we are both very happy about itnot worth the money it doesnt really cool or keep things cool celsius below fahrenheit is celsius fahrenheitbut it said or so really it was celsius fahrenheitmy food and drinks were when it was and i should have saw it only lowers below ambient temperature its cool to have like a prototype or something but not very usefultook this on vacation kept drinks and snacks cool not really cold liked not having to deal with melted icei run local am out to hours a day and the drinks are nice and fridge cold by time i go home i can load it up with tons of oz drinks and my lunch i have even had a salad stay nice and crisp in there for hours befor i got to it i do add some cheap ice packs in the am just to help it along in the cooling but it stays nice and cold all day tons of room for all you will need in a hr period the pockets are excellent for all my personal items throughout the day its taken place of my backpack very worth the pricethe cooler is fine but the car charger end broke within a week of using the cooler i have asurion warranty but ive called times and chatted online, and they havent gotten me the part yet they all gave different information each time and keep saying they will call me back but no one ever calls me back its been months now and im still trying to get this part i wouldnt bother with getting asurion warranty seems to have been a big waste of timethe cooling mechanism is on the side your cant put anything that will block the incoming cool air with another words you cant filled it up with anything cos everything you put in it actually blocks the airway the cooling should be on the lid it is useless and the convertor gets way too hot right awaythe fan was so noisy i couldnt put it in the back seat and listen to the radio cooling works but is minimal on the positive side, it held a bunch of ice without leakingvraiment de mauvaise qualit , la courroie bandoulire pour transporter sur lepaule as lch aprs une semaine et le connecteur de lallume cigarette as fondu aprs mois de perduje ne recommande vraiment pasbought this cooler for my hubby to use in his semi for his drinks its the perfect size he keeps in handy on the passenger seat so he can always have a cold drink when he wants one he used the long strap to secure it over the back of the seat so the cooler stays securely in place very happy with this"

occasional trapped hair to break free before a severe razor bump can form my braun shaver worked but caused a deep razor bump that eventually turned into a cyst that bump patrol could not prevent bump patrol is not a magic wand, but its a great tool to have in the fight against razor bumpsive been using this product for decades extremely happy with my resultsi have been looking forward to reviewing this for quite a while, and awaiting a time when i can express all of my thoughts to everyoneso i have had large bumps on my neck for god knows how long they never get any bigger or smaller, but they have always just been there clearly they wereare an effect of improper shaving at some point or another no matter what i have tried, the size of those bumps has never gone down at all i have been very self conscious about that for quite some timei read a lot of good reviews for this product, and figured it could not hurt to give it a try so here is my journeyi typically shave every other day, as i am not a fan of facial hair, especially on my neck as i began using this product, i stretched it to every three days, and then again to every four days i figured this would give my neck the longest opportunity to heal all during this time, i continued to use this product, everyday, usually once in the morning, and once at night i also used it every time after i shaved and each time i shaved, i made sure to take extra special care on my neck, to ensure i would not regress or become worseafter a week of use, i did not notice too much of a change two weeks, slight change for the better, and this continued on gradually i am now on four weeks, and it is a world of difference i truly wish i had taken a before picture, so i could post before and after pictures while not completely gone just yet, those three bumps on my neck are remarkably smaller than they were when i started using this product they are practically nonexistent at this point when i see myself in the mirror, i can tell they have definitely shrunk when i blindly feel at my neck with my hand, i can barely feel the current largest bump, as it has almost completely disappearedi cannot say enough good things about this product if you suffer or have a similar issue, i strongly encourage you to give this product a try, and to have patience you probably will not notice immediate results, but i can attest that it is worth the patience and effortworks okay i get bumps pretty bad after shaving and when i use this i still get bumps but not as much as i did without itso far havent found anything that works better than thislove this product i have very sensitive skin after shaving and break out with large, red bumps this product has greatly reduced the number of bumps and their size probably less and the remaining are much less noticeable highly recommendhealing effectivenessnot oily and workshave been using this product for so many year until recently when i bought a butch that felt thin and diluted

kitchen seasonal dcor seasonal lighting indoor string lights,"definitely not a bad product and worth the pricethe pros they do give a very nice mood lighting to the room thats just the right brightness for me, and the stars and moons are really nice looking when lit upthe cons theyre very difficult to untangle i tried for a few hours to untangle these and eventually gave up instead of hanging them on the wall like i intended i just put the tangled clump on top of a bookshelf out of view and let what i could untangle hang down on either side im keeping them since i was able to make it work, but im basically only able to use about half the string of lights theyre very fragile i dropped the lights on the carpet by accident and a few of the pieces were slightly damaged, however they all still work the plastic is very strong smelling after days i still smell the plastic, its not a big deal but i hope it will eventually go awayoverall, they look nice, but not the bestmy husband and i love these lights it took us about minutes to detangle and hang up we bought some for a youtube background but also something that we can set up in our pavilion since we are in the sca and belegarth we are looking for new ways to make our tent home its about square feet and were doing tarot as well so it will be a cute feature for reading the cards at night if we deside to do a reading at night their about as bright as my salt lamp so if you happen to have one of those thats how bright they are i love all the settings and they are bigger than i thought they would be but we will order more sets to go around our tent im most likely going to get a water tight container to put over our power plugs i figured i would post how big the stars and moons were with a hand point of view, my hands are tiny so i used my husbands as well for different reference sizes i wish we could change the color since our fighting units color is blue it would be cool to have it customizable like some led strips but the warm light is very comforting and romantic thanks for a great product and we will buy again to extend our chain i will add that you can have the electric plug on either side so thats a bonus you dont have to worry about what side to plug it in on i only used the light for day only because i just received it, so this is an initial judgement, and i will update if i noticed anything wrong about the productthe order arrived in a good conditionthe rod of lights was well packed but tangled a little bit not much, but dont be scared, just follow the directions that came with the product and in no time youll untangle it and will be okit have a lot of light effects like flash and fast winks and soft effects, i liked the soft fade effect and the steady lights the best, because all the other effects are kind of loud and annoying for my eyesdont cut the plastic ties because it is what makes the shape of the light rod thank youlove these lights very bright and very good in size unlike other really small ones these are huge, i wish they comes with a remote and different modes thoughpictures are deceptive for size, especially in comparison to other sellers but other than the size i wouldnt change anything about the entire experience from beginning to end well, maybe order another strip good job"

glasses but when i scratched my black iridium polarized lenses i was pretty bummed since these cost from oakley i found seekoptics and with coupon two sets of polarized lenses black iridium polarized and blue mirror polarized cost less than oakley replacement glasses can range from , so to get two polarized lenses is crazyso performancewise these lenses are the same as oakley in terms of polarization where the seek optics version differs is that it doesnt have the oakley branding, it doesnt say polarized, and the lens itself isnt as stiff time will only tell how these hold up but from a value standpoint, these are a no brainer as long as you dont mind the lack of oakley brandingfirst of all, i dont understand why there are no reviews on these amazing lenses theyre clear, perfect fit and over less than the same thing offered by oakley the only thing they dont have is the ""oakley"" name stamped in the top they are polarized and the lens color is nice, smooth and even i was expecting something that would make me want to spend on the oakley lenses but, instead i got something that makes me want to drop another on more seek opticsif money is no object you just gotta have the oakley name, by all means, drop the extra to get the name but, if clarity, fit, form, function and value are your main concerns try seek optic lensesi doubt youll be disappointedi have only wiped these down to clean off my fingerprints after installation once i have to give these a good washing a time of , ill update their status right now, after having them day using them in the sun once, i am very well pleased in the quality of the seek optic lenses highly recommend them to othersupdate i have washed these lenses in plain water, mild soap water and had them get blown off of my car onto rocks during a heavy storm the rocks put a light scratch on the lens its unnoticeable unless looking for it the cleaning hasnt caused any of the coating to degrade theyre in the same condition as day except for the minor scratch mentioned earlier i stand by my original review am planning for another lens purchase in the very near future this time, i may go with the decepticon purple i would love to see them make a pair of transition lenses, that way i could use them at work for my safety glassesthese are of the price of the original lenses and the perform just as well i admit that the finish on the originals just feels a bit better, but these work great i mostly ride during sunrise and sunset hours and while the oakley lenses perform flawlessly with no blinding glare these are almost equally as good if they only last a year ill still be happy given the pricefast shipping and excellent comunicationthere are several features of this lens that make it not as good as original oakley lenses the real dealbreaker is the photochromic lens is not clear under low light, and they dont seem to get darker under bright sunlight they color is like lightly tinted sunglasses, even when the lenses are indoors at night the polarization differs between the left and right sides, and there is overall distortion the quality is not so bad that the lens is awful, but if youre expecting something as good as oakleys, forget itit is so clear and when it gets dark is still pretty clear and i felt protected i ordered knockoff oakley jawbreakers and this lens to go together these are the clearest lenses i have ever used and they work very well nice and reflective from the front, easy to clean, gorgeous look polarized, they reduce glare and reduce eye strain well worth the money, just wanted a redorange option for a second pairpassgenau in der jawbreaker, die polarisierte verflscht die farben leider starkawesome replacement lenses for oakley jawbreakers and these wont break the

variety of this tape, but this stuff is easy to remove, even if you dont want it to be nasty adhesive cover on this tiny "" tape requires a tweezer and magnifying glasses to remove these are great, the cartridges appear to be well made, its actually a pretty complicated little packi use mostly the black on yellow, like this one, due to the contrast mostly i use that for labelingdvds that are now going back into cases again i threw hundreds of the old ones away because i wasdriving across country and had zero need to transport all of that lots of people throw the entire case andliner away and put these in those carry all disc bags i really like having them on the shelf, with the title out,displayed individually ive also used red on white, good stuff too along with black on blue, i used that for myblu rays im guessing that its my relatively new printer that i may have bonked on the side one time, butoccasionally these cartridges will begin printing and then the tape gets stuck as it is feeding and it just getsjammed in there and wont print you have to open the machine, force out the cart, and then waste several inches of tapeto get it realigned, i guess i dont think i can blame the carts for thatthe labeling tape is ok i found a need for a few different widths it is amazing how much this makes a differencethe biggest benefit i have with dymos tape is that it has printed clearly and consistently as long as my batteries are in good condition weak batteries poor lettering qualitythe biggest drawbacks that i have are the spools are so short feet, the backing is a bit challenging to get peeled if you have short finger nails, and the official dymo brand "" width is actually quite expensive i found a dymo competitors tape with a number a to be up to rd the price i will be ordering some soon and hope the quality is at least comparableso why does feet seem short to me a lot of my labels are inches in length, but the label is printed with blank space before and after the printed content so they turn out to be inches long that means i get labels per foot on average so if i use labels per foot that means i get labels per cartridge at cost of cents each since i never know the exact printed length of the labels, sometimes i find myself printing two of them, or even three, to find the right font size to fit the space i have which means i can get a few as usable labels per cartridge at a cost of about cents eachthat is my experience, so the competitors similar pricing with bulk purchases of packs and free shipping seems tantalizing and have them in my inbox to give them a tryso how much can you say about label tapes the either work or they dont these labels work very well for my dymo label maker i got the label maker and the tapes primarily to label containers that i freeze food in prior to this, i was using masking tape the masking tape worked, but it always left residue that i had to scrape off these labels stick to the container, but are easily removed without leaving any residue i also like using the label maker for this task because i can set up a label and print up to at a time this is so much easier than manually writing on masking tape for the number of labels that i need i also like that the backing on the labels is easy to remove the backing is split so that you remove half at a time this is also so much easier than the old embossed label makers that may or may not leave the little tab to pull off the backingthis product is excellent the print quality is great, very clear just be careful of what sizes refills you buy the "" will give you a restricted font size i didnt realize how tinny tiny it would be just a heads up enjoyi find that the label does not stick properly so have to add sticking tap to the edgesthis is good labeling tape i like the black lettering on white background because it works on everything and i dont have to keep swapping cartridges the inch size has, so far, been perfect for me for labeling everything in sight the letters are nice and big, easy to read the ink dries instantly and doesnt run when wet i tried it i put these labels on my dry goods containers and i have had no peeling over time ive had the labels on for a few months, even with the powdered goods like flour, which i use often the paper backing on the tape is presliced down the center for easy removal, and the glue feels strongwhile this item is very useful, and works incredibly well for its given purpose, one must know how to properly install it i managed to waste a lot of dymo tape because i made the mistake of disarranging the tape that said, if you manage to install it incorrectly, you can always use the label as a stickon label i would always recommend product alignment if you intend on buying the dymo labelwriter as i did, i would very much recommend using this specific brand of tapeusual great service and valuegood colour of black text on light blue filmperfect for home filing of boring documents etcbuy the genuine dymo labels, you will always get qualityi really like the results i didnt find it difficult to switch cartridges at all and so far all the labels made are staying put like

speakers docks portable bluetooth speakers,"unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun, i used it for work as a fedex express courier, not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls, arm rests, cruise control, or insulation from the elements, we dont have speakers imagine hours on the road in a loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stressso one night i decided, no more of that this speaker fit right into the passengers ""seat"", and i would strap the seatbelt just incase the trucks had world class terrible suspension, the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flyingwith that, at full volume in the truck that battery might last around or hours but man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise, tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body, everything it made my driving experience so much better that being said, i would only need full volume on the highway did you know express trucks are governed to mph well, assuming our trucks could even easily reach that at least in my station they all had check engine lights and i once timed that it took seconds to go from mph to mph fun and when i was driving from mph having the speaker at was fine at that rate i could make it last about hours before needing a rechargei thank jbl for creating such a great speaker and frankly i am sure their other products have that battery capacity i needed, but i got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack for the situation i was in, it was a total game changer i went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs on the offchance another courier reads this, making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery i will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mindluckily i do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use, but when i needed it, my life was much better for it it sat next to an open door in an isuzu reach and never moved a centimeter, providing me with amazing sound all the while i know now anything and everything i might throw at it will never take it down if battery life is your concern, it is valid if you want the best sound for the size of the speaker, this is hard to beat, and it has my ""doing deliveries in a tin can with an open door on a road at mph still sounding good"" seal of approvali was debating between the jbl charge and a different version of the jbl and im so glad i went with this one the sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely jbl speakers on amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop the quality is amazing and its so load for how small it is this one doesnt come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality i havent had any issues or scratches and ive just been throwing it in a tote bag the charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast if youre debating between this one and a pricier one i would go with the charge not into the latest commercial fads but i am very impressed by these radios the size and sound is about the same as a high end radio this streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with ""bad reception"" truly a revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience living in nyc i am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from massachusetts along with one in my area that has a weak signal i love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference i own a much higher end, powerful, stereo system for a more engaging musical experience a well designed, water resistant, portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors have fun finding some of your out of area online radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technologyi had this model on hold for a long while as i searched for the best all around speaker for my year old sons bday this thing is awesome sound is crisp and clear and no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level from rap to reggaton this speaker is awesome jbl is an old us brand and still putting out a great product even the color design is solid without peeling i have two more on my list for christmas for my other son and my husband i definitely recommend buying the case this does come with a usb ""c"" type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall this is also a charger and has an onoff button volume is controlled by bluetooth on smart phone instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation make sure you look all yhrough the box so you dont accidentally throw the cord outno escribo reseas habitualmente, pero esta vez creo que es necesario, quiz hasta pueda hacer que alguno de ustedes no la compreme explicohe tenido una jbl flip durante los ltimos meses y he estado contento con ella, hasta hace un par de semanas en que decid que era momento de otra bocina porttil con buena calidad de sonido pero un poco ms potente me puse a investigar que modelos podran servirme y la lista de bocinas en ste rango de precios parece interminable, por ejemplo bos soundlink mini ii, beats pill, sony xb, marshall stockwell, etc acud a las sucursales de bestbuy y costco de mi localidad para probar cada una de ellas la que ms me convenci de stas fue la bos soundlink mini ii, porque creo que est bastante equilibrada, pero an siento que le falta potencia y est un poco inflada de preciofue entonces cuando record que hace algn tiempo haba tenido oportunidad de probar una jbl charge y me sorprendi bastante de manera positiva a final de cuentas la decisin qued entre la bos soundlink mini ii y la jbl charge, opt por esta ltimaal llegar a la tienda de bestbuy de m localidad los modelos de charge haban sido descontinuados y liquidados hacia un par de meses y acababa de llegar el nuevo modelo la jbl charge desafortunadamente todava no la tenan instalada para realizar una prueba de audio, pero en ese momento pens si la otra ya era buena, esta debe ser mejorme fij en el precio en bestbuy cuesta cerca de pesos chequ el precio en amazon y en ese momento estaba en ahora est en parece una ganga, pero ojo, todava no termino de explicar antes de comprarla decid ver diferentes opiniones de ""expertos"" personas que la haban probado antes en youtubellegue a casa y vi todas las reviews qu hay en youtube sobre la charge literalmente, as como las de un tal clavinetjunkie algo as que me parece el menos sesgado y con una opinin ms profesional, con menos marketingpara resumir todas las reviews de jbl charge exaltaban las bondades de esta bocina es w ms potente, se carga con usb tipo c, que tiene ms batera mah, ms tiempo las actualizaciones va ota, etcsin embargo, si se fijan casi nadie la recomienda por encima de la charge por una razn es monoauraltodas esas reviews que les comento mencionan que el hecho de que la bocina sea monoaural no compromete la calidad del audio y que a final de cuentas el de los usuarios estarn contentos con ellaentonces lo s, la regu compr la bocina sin probarla previamente la compr por amazon por el costo pesos lleg, la recib en el trabajo un par de compaeros que la escucharon apenas sali de la caja estuvieron contentos con el sonido sin embargo a m no me convenca no saba por qu pero en ese momento supe que soy parte del restanteal llegar a casa y poner la msica que consigue muy buenos efectos en modo estereo ahora se me ocurre red balloons de nena, what a fool believes, shoot to thrill de acdc, etc no consegua encontrar los detalles del sonido no me malinterpreten, la bocina consigue crear un buen soundstage, el bajomediosagudos me parecen equilibrados, a pesar de tener la preeq de jbl, es solo que al interpretar todo a travs de un solo canal de audio se pierden todos esos detalles que disfruto de la msica suena como el radio de la cocina de mi abuelita lo notarn al compararla con otra en modo estreoen finfue tanta mi decepcin que decid regresarla y comprar la jbl charge la bos soundlink mini ii en su lugar por ahora no tengo conflicto con ninguna de stas de pensar en cargarlas con un microusb a pesar de que el galaxy s slo tenga tipo c o el tener una menor cantidad de batera, si con ello consigo el sonido que me gustacreo que jbl trato de disminuir costos y obtener ms ganancias en esta edicin de charge esto se puede ver porque le quitaron hasta el micrfono, que podra ser de utilidad para tomar una llamada urgente si estas en una alberca, o lejos de tu telfonoojal la charge mejore estos aspectos no siempre lo ms nuevo es mejorespero te haya sido de utilidadthe charge comes in at a larger size than its predecessor the charge , mainly due to the increased battery sizethe sound is tuned more towards the mid highs and is lacking bassive spent the last days doing side by side comparisons with my charge , and my conclusion is while the charge does have larger battery for charging your phone, the lack of bass and larger size make the charge underwhelming if you find the charge on sale for or under pick that up instead it is still the gold standardthe sound is really crisp and bright in the middle ranges the high frequency response definitely attenuates the bass really lacks between to hz where the sound effectively cuts off entirely at around hz regardless if using bass boost electronic music with sub hz literally cuts off the speaker is rated for hz so i cant knock them off for something i agreed to buyaesthetically, the device looks and feels excellent i look forward to making use of itall in all, the device is good but i would say you are paying more than what you get then again portable speaker sound quality is inherently gimped so you cant expect to get the same quality for the same price as another type of sound systemthe jbl charge is, in my opinion, the best of its class for size, battery life, sound quality, and build its not too big at all perfect size can easily carry it in your hand or a backpack without any problems the advertised battery life of hours is valid and lasts me a week or more depending on use and volume it also charges up pretty fast and can be used as a power bank to charge other devices the sound quality is astonishing it provides plenty of base, clarity in mids and highs, as well as a lot of volumes, eg, can fill my house will sound without breaking a sweat in my opinion, it far surpasses the likes of its competitors like the ue boom , jbl flip , sony xb, etc the build quality and aesthetics are also gorgeous the mesh material on the outside provides a premium look and feel while protecting the speaker as well, given its ipx waterproof rating if you are looking for a portable, premium sounding, bluetooth speaker, i would highly recommend purchasing this the only reason i would consider something like the ue boom or jbl flip is if you really really need it to be portable because the jbl charge is quite portable and provides much better sound quality and battery life, which makes it worth the extra moneyes una muy chula bocina, he tenido bocinas de gama baja por asi decirlo la primera fue una jbl go monoaural, para el tamao era buena, solo que no tenia nada de graves la otra fue un regalo era una perfect choice de w stereo y no me termino de convencer su sonido despues tuve una philips monoaural de w y suena bien, solo que le hacia falta mas graves y la bateria se quedaba muy corta, y ahora me decidi invertir en algo mas tenia ganas de una sony por las luces, pero mucha gente decia que cuando llegaba a bateria baja se le bajaba el volumen y detalles asi, y no me terminaron de convencer luego aparecio esta bestia no estaba acostumbrado a bocinas grandes y solo dije wow se escucha muy bien, no hay distorsion, tiene un volumen muy bueno y tiene unos bajos excelentes mucha gente se queja de que es monoaural, pero siento que no es muy importante en una bocina portatil, fuera sonido pues ahi si me lo pienso, pero yo prefiero mas calidad de sonido que el efecto stereo, y no decepciona en nada ecualizando la musica le vas a sacar mas provecho a los graves, solo que toma en cuenta que disminuiras el volumen en un o aumentando graves estoy muy contento con esta bocina, jbl no decepciona no hay distorsion y su bateria me ha llegado a durar de a horas a volumen medio con graves si cuesta menos de aprovechenla, es una muy buena oportunidad"

solid laundry detergent option to find these the reviews are convincing enough, but i didnt really know what to expect as ive really only used liquid detergents before however, i have been trying to find ways to cut out plastic use to the best of my abilities and this seemed like an easy and logical step to take scents have also been irritating my sinuses and asthma a lot these days, so i wanted to find something that was scent free but still left things feeling fresh so, i ordered these and decided to see what happenedive been using them now for a couple of months they last way longer than liquid detergent, take up way less space in my very small apartment, and my clothes come out feeling clean and fresh every single time theres almost no difference to the clean feel that i got from liquid detergents my sinuses and asthma problems have been better after making the switch to these, also might be unrelated, but it feels related enough as i havent changed much elsefinally, it just feels really good using a product that works very well and also reduces my waste i highly recommend these to anyone who is looking to just take a simple step in reducing their ecofootprint or just wants to try something a little more allergy friendly im going to continue to buy and use these for as long as i am ablethese are fantastic simple as can be just toss part of a sheet in with your laundry i just toss mine right on top of my load and youre doneand economical i compared the price when i bought them to the liquid detergent i had been using and it was no contest at all i did find some cheaper powder options, but not by as much as i would have expected these were clearly on the low end of the spectrum and for me the effectiveness, simplicity and lack of mess mean they more than pay for themselves youll find lower cost options but i cant imagine feeling like these are exorbitantone of the greatest things is the flexibility the sheets are sized according to the most detergent youre likely to need in any load i end up using half a sheet for normal loads, a quarter sheet for small loads, and for really big loads or just a little extra oomph i dont think ive ever used a full sheet youll get far more loads out of these than there are sheetsi find them perfectly effective, performing on par with other detergents weve used laundry needs at our house are pretty basic our clothes get lived in before we wash, but we dont deal with a ton of major stains and odors constantly ive got some everyday stains out with these alone ive paired these with regular bleach and had good results, so i reckon you could use other additives with them just fine but check out some other reviews if you think you need something heavierduty than ive needed these for, or if you have particular sensitivitiesanother thing worth noting, ive had bad luck with powder in general in the past, with it not dissolving properly, especially in cold water which is a small majority of my laundry for our basic uses, these seem to dissolve no problem ive never found any residue or anything either in the washer afterward or on any clothespast that, ive found storage and tidiness are side benefits this tiny box as opposed to a huge tub yes please the cardboard isnt so strong youll reuse the box after, but its as sturdy as it needs to be and the ""drawer"" design lets you save partial sheets on top of the stack for next time neat as a pin, with no drips or grains to wipe up after keep it high enough that nothing wet will spill on it and give your shelf some breathing roomwhat else fresh scent thats not overly strong, obviously all the ecological and sustainability benefits i may tinker around with other laundry options when its time to replace these just to experiment but these set a high bar for our needsi have been using these laundry sheets for about a year now and i like that there is no plastic jug to fill the landfill with the laundry sheets are meant to be cut in half for a full load but if i have a very small load i can cut into smaller pieces and they are much more economical that say a laundry pod the plastic pods did not dissolve well but these laundry sheets leave no residue behind even after washing in cold water i have even convinced my budget savvy daughter to buy laundry sheets we have been on vacation a few times now and the laundry sheets are so easy to pack in the suitcase i am about to order again the fresh linen scent i have a sensitive nose and cannot tolerate strong perfumes but the linen scent is very mildi had to stop using pods because i kept finding partially dissolved pods in the laundry after the cycle i dont have that problem with the sheets its also a small box, rather than a big jugrecently, my son in law was talking about one of the kids getting rashes on his back i had a box i hadnt opened yet, so i gave it to them as far as i know, problem solved unscented is a good thingim not a fan of the plastic jugs but the laundry sheet manufacturers arent the solution i should have crunched the numbers before i bought the laundry sheetsweve had the solution for generationsname brand powdered laundry detergents which have been dermatologist tested, are biodegradable, come in cardboard packaging, and are priced considerably less loads if you rip them in half for small loads or name brand oz hec compatible loads for the same amount of moneyoverall, product worked well would only recommend for travelling purposes thoughi got these after watching a documentary about how the planet is dying i panicked and bought a bunch of ecofriendly house products i figured i would give it a shot but i doubted these sheets could work like my tide which i have used my entire life well well welllet me tell you i was shocked when they came out of the dryer and my clothes felt luxurious super soft with no fabric softener the scented ones dont stay scented through the dryer so the lack of scent is something to get used to but may try their scent booster my towels felt fluffier so naturally like a crazy lady i ran upstairs and compared it to a towel i washed with tide and they are actually softer and visibly fluffier this is so cool a product that is made in the usa, eco friendly and is actually superior to my other brand i am impressed"

your prompt reply this is very important to us, thank you in advancesincerelyyaber customer service team""original review starsi was almost going to give this stars maybe but then i went to use this thing only for the flood light while working on the roof of my rv in the dark, and lo and behold, the charge the unit had the day before was down to prior to this, the unit would say even after a jump, so perhaps the battery monitor system was not reporting accurately and the real percentage was lower than stated, but i couldnt be bothered to do a bunch of tests with only a couple days left in the return window, and much more pressing projects needing to be done hence working in the dark late at nightthe only complaint i had before this was the need to usually rehook the jumper cables to the battery to get the unit to register and start its internal jump protocol essentially, just turning off the safety feature and allowing the battery to power the jumper cables, if i understand correctly sometimes this needed to be done two or three times to get the yaber to do its thing, but once it recognized the battery and activated, my toyota sequoia with its large battery and engine turned over no problem if the battery had managed to hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time, i would have definitely kept this unit i didnt even get to test the air compressor yet, but i was eager to find out if it could really put out the psi and fill my psi rv tires oh well maybe others will have better luck, but i didnt have time to monkey aroundoriginal postnever even got to try it, as the only time the display would turn on was if the usb was plugged into a charger not included and it would just sit at charging manual states that at least a usba v a is needed to charge and fortunately i had several laying around the house but they all yield the same result, no chargingupdatedyaber saw my review and even though i had returned the original yaber ya, they insisted on making things right and offered to send me a different unit i accepted and they sent me the yaber yr which is a smaller unit with similar jump start specifications but without the tire inflator i have tried it several times mainly with smaller vehicles like a moped but did disconnect the battery on my ram hemi l and had no issue starting it this unit doesnt have the protruding power button thats prone to battery drain during shipping or storage if depressed like the ya they did inform me that the ya is due to be redesigned to address the issue and i look forward to getting it when it isconclusionalthough the original item purchased does not meet my conditions for a star review, the care and customer support from yaber should be more than enough to instill confidence in the brand and the fact that they stand behind their products and truly appreciate their customersthe product was smaller than i thought and comes with a nice case for charging you can use the included usb c to a cable but it doesnt come with a power brick i used my laptops charger but it wasnt the fastest the two usb charging ports on the device charge at different rates, with the top port showing w on the display and the bottom showing w im not sure if this is actual wattage though because when the air pump is being used it shows w, so maybe its a percentage of total poweri am a fan of the air compressor feature you can easily present the pressure you want and then just press the air button and it will automatically pump air until the pressure is reached also the air line is long enough to reach the top of my tire on my subaru crosstrek i could definitely see it being too short to reach the top of a larger cars tire, but its easy enough to just pick up while it automatically pumps the product also include different air pump tips so you can inflate a ball or whatever else too oh yeah and its pretty loud while pumping airfor the battery, it charged half of my phone battery with of its own battery i wish it had a v output instead of the dc, but thats just me last, the light is nice a bright and can rotate all the way around and drains the battery very slowly so you can keep it on for a long timewhen i recieved the yaber jump starter the manual says to use a va adapter with the provided cord the original didnt charge from the moment it was deliveredthe seller made things right by sending another model and it works great it was delivered within days after contacting the selleri would like to thank them for there quick action in making it rightthis car charging kit is great so far, i have tried the light and used the air compressor the light is bright and i love that its rotatable the compressor worked like a charm on my mid size suv tire the manual advises to allow the charger to rest after using it for so long please do just with filling one tire from psi to psi, the compressor cord got very, very warm to the touch i let it cool before storing as for the other features, hopefully they work just as well when needed a good buyunit even warned me i crossed the positive and negative connection because the battery terminal are not color coded in my car and after jump starting the car with battery thats been dead a week it started the first try then i put air in the tire and still had power left its a good purchasegot used one that the air compressor didnt work instead of new one and didnt got the manual this shows that the unit used the stars are for the costumer service jhabite la montagne, et il arrive rgulirement que ma batterie se dcharge plus rapidement quelle ne devrait et avec le confinement, le tltravail, ma peugeot roule beaucoup moins quauparavant, cela na pas aid non plus vous vous en doutez on na pas toujours des cbles sous la main et un bon samaritain pour nous aider, je me suis donc dit quil tait temps dinvestir dans un booster de batterie qui rpondrait ce besoin, et qui en plus me permettrait de charger mes appareils mobiles, tablettes, lors des voyagesjai donc longuement hsit avant de raliser mon achat de booster de batterie tellement il existe de modles diffrents puissance, taille, fonctionnalits aprs

pochette de transport le rapport qualit prix est parfait et la livraison a t rapide et soignedans les faits, yaber vous recommande de le charger compltement avant sa premire utilisation cela ma pris peu prs h via un port de charge rapide usb ss sur mon ordinateur jai ensuite branch le yaber sur ma batterie en suivant les instructions du manuel traduit en plusieurs langues ma voiture a dmarr du premier coup, puis sest r teinte la batterie tait vraiment trs faible jai alors activ le mode ""forage"" du booster un petit bouton prvu cet effet et l nickel, a a fonctionn sans problme jai dmarr ma peugeot dont la batterie tait quasiment plat grce au yaber en a peine minutes en tenant compte du premier essai et le booster a toujours la batterie pleine un systme de leds indique le niveau de charge du boosterje valide cet investissement que je ne regrette absolument pas et je le recommande vivement tous ceux qui comme moi vivraient une situation similairepermet de faire dmarrer ma bmw d lorsque la batterie est plat, mais aussi en cas de forte baisse de temprature o elle a du mal dmarrer en attendant de changer de batterie, car elle fonctionne bien en temprature au dessus de ce

possible par usbc permet une recharge plus rapide je ne lutilise gure comme powerbank mme si cette fonctionnalit est pratique et peut savrer tre utile, mais je ne saurais dire si la capacit relle correspond celle annoncebien plus pratique quun cble de dmarrage qui ncessite une me charitable et parfois des manoeuvres compliques voire impossible pour suffisamment rapprocher les deux voituresle seul ""bmol"" est que je dois systmatiquement activer le bouton ""forage"" pour que cela fonctionne, le branchement seul allumage de la powebank na aucun effet sur le dmarragebonjour , je vient dacqurir votre produit avec je voie des note pour la plupart des commentaires positif donc jai acheter votre produit qui me semblais magique hors quans je lai reue un simple utilitaire berlingot auquel sa batterie tais fatiguer et il na pas pu le dmarrer je compter sur lui hors il nous a laisser dans lambarra en attendant la dpanneuse je suis super due de votre produit cest la premire fois

instructions, even for a novice like me it would be nice if the packet came with an extra screw in each size my only other suggestion might be for closet maid to prestamp each piece with the ""name"" it is given in the instructions especially in light of the fact that some boards are the same size, but have a different pattern of predrilled holes you can see what i mean, belowi am a smart woman people even tell me that, sometimes most dont know that i am terrible at ""spatial ability"" i cant figure out how to put things like puzzles together very well my brain just doesnt see that way but today i unboxed the shelving unit some assembly required i ordered in a fit of overconfidence while surfing the web at am a few weeks agoi gathered my tools a screwdriver and a hammer, just like the instructions told me to i reviewed how many of every screw there was, and what they were called ""assembly"" screw, thats an ""assembly"" screw i would even say it out loud to reinforce the concept i counted the precut, predrilled boards and stacked them neatly into piles by sizei bribed the yearold to help gramma, and he did so willingly, at first i got the side board connected to the top board, or maybe it was the bottom board and was feeling fairly proud of myself but the instructions called for me to fit ""short dowels"" into predrilled holes in the top board or maybe it was the bottom board but the stupid dowels wouldnt fit so i pulled out the instructions and realized i had picked up a horizontal divider when what i needed was a fixed shelf same size but the dowels would fit into this one who knewso i unscrewed the first two boards, and grabbed a postit notepad and labeled all the boards just in case i had the year old help me again hold the boards while i reattached the fixed shelf to the side board or maybe it was a top board once again, when it came time to screw the top board or maybe bottom to the vertical board, i realized there was no predrilled hole the year old had the best view and better vision and noticed immediately that the predrilled hole was on the wrong side so we detached the screws again and turned the board around i was so sure i had it right this time, too and the rescrewing was far quicker but you guessed it, i had the finished side only one of the four sides was finished pointing the wrong direction so we backtracked againeventually, the year old wandered off to play with his brother he told me i should be more careful duly noted and i urged him to keep that play appointment in the other room pronto so, with careful rereading of the instructions in three languages and diligence with the postit notes that kept sliding off the slick finish, i continued to assemble the shelfunit with only one near amputation when the ""real wood"" board probably that stupid fixed shelf, or maybe it was the vertical divider slid out of my grip and landed faint millimeters from my toe that board was heavy, too it even shook the house of course it didanyway, i counted and there were precisely eighteen ""assembly screws"" and not one more and not one less i guarded them with my life, counting before and after every potty break and coffee run finally, with the unit mostly assembled, i came to the ""backing"" which turned out to be a folded piece of cardboardhey, what happened to the ""real wood"" and it turned out, there were only three, despite the fact there were six openings and now you know my sense of ""style"" is as absent as my spatial ability covering only three of the six squares provides a unique ""look"" at least to all nonocd customers nevertheless, i persistedeach piece of folded cardboard was nailed down with, i kid you not, teeny pinlike nails, called ""nails"" in the instructions ciou, ciavo, nail that whole languages thing and these things were designed by an absolute star genius imagine the amount of research it must have taken to size these pins to the exact the depth of my thumb i was in awe because that precision measurement resulted in me not being able to even ""start"" the nail without slamming into my thumb thirtysix times, if you dont count all the ones that fell out before i could get the nail stabilized i checked for ""hacks to avoid hitting your thumb"" on my phone, after only five or six nails i told you i was smart and discovered that you can hold a nail between the teeth of your comb or your husbands comb, if he is not at home bonus, as you are pounding the bejabbers out of everything in the vicinity of your microscopic nailpin, the comb appears to act as a protective agent for the shelf or maybe it was the horizontal divider the comb, however, did turn out to be mostly a total lossbut i did it i assembled a ""some assembly required"" shelving unit and it only took me six hoursps you may need ice for the finger you forgot to move during the flailingsocalled hammering you did prior to the comb hackpps and save the ice because it turns out that all those boards nailed together are far heavier than the single board that missed your toe earlierenjoy"

house hold use, testing outlets, etc wanted a safe meter, see youtube videos for a guy who zaps it with kilovolts this meter came out second best to a fluke plenty accurate for my use amprobe is owned by fluke and is tested in fluke labs the only negative are the leads when i measured the resistance of the leads the readings jumped all over the place i tried cleaning with papertowel and isopropyl alcohol no help then i used a very fine abrasive pad with alcohol, now the resistance is zero also made the continuity function much quicker and consistent must be corrosion or some kind of coating on the probes many choices for dmms in the sub range almost bought a fluke this meter has more features, current, loaded battery tester, ncv, relative, backlight and stand, rubbery case the fluke is true rms, has a stronger plastic case and is more compact i think i made the right choice ps i have a fluke but wanted a cheaper meter for less exacting tasksi used a basic multimeter from craftsman for years i use these for electronics hobbies that need a bit more detail than the basics but without needing the full functionality of a fluke as we have in my work lab excellent balance of price and featuresprice point is excellent accurate great featuresi did a lot of research on multimeters before choosing to order this one from amprobe for the balance of price and features from a reputable manufacturer, this is a decent product i chose amprobe over the many other chinese made brands primarily because they have a reputation for build quality, safety features, and reliability confirmed by rigorous testing done by reputable reviewers amprobe is a division of fluke arguably the industry leader, providing a lowerpriced product line this amprobe am is designed primarily for use by the diy homeowner this unit does not have true rms or temperature readings, but the am line provides more featurerich units, for professional use, at higher price points the am has all the basic features and functionality to tackle most home electrical projects which i expect to encounter the autoranging, noncontact voltage sensing which i found to work better than some other reviews indicated, basic battery test feature, and integrated flashlight are all pluses the backlight feature is both a plus and the primary minus of this product on the plus side, the backlight does not shut off after a few seconds like many other multimeters it will actually stay lit until you turn it off however, i found that, for some reason, when the backlight is on the screen can only be read in a very narrow range just a few degrees on the vertical plane if you tilt the meter up or down beyond that narrow range, the numerals fade out completely and cant be read when i discovered this on the first unit i received from amazon, i returned it when i found that the replacement unit did the same thing, i contacted amprobe technical support one very nice thing is that the number on the amprobe packaging actually connects you to the fluke us offices and you actually reach a us technician the tech i spoke with pulled an am off the shelf to see if he could replicate the issue and was surprised to discover that screenbacklight behaved exactly the same as mine he said he had not been aware of the issue previously he then went on to pick up and test other meters in the am line the , , , and and found they all had the same issue its strange to me that an issue like that hasnt been mentioned before but, it is what it is ive worked with many kinds of electronic equipment with backlit screens and have never seen this problem on any of them as i said at the beginning, this is a good unit for the price and, for me, this quirk was not a big enough problem to send it back and start shopping all over again but, if youre interested in buying one of these amprobes, be aware that you might and probably will run into the same issuefirst, let it be said if you are a professional electrician who needs a meter for everyday use, and needs the utmost in durability, quality and accuracy why are you looking at this multimeter i read a couple of reviews picking apart this low priced, meter and was left scratching my head a bit if you want a meter, then go buy a fluke or equivalent dont buy this, then measure it up to professional meters and write scathing reviews because it does not hold up to the scrutiny and measurement of much more expensive metersi previously had only an innova multimeter that i got here on amazon for around and it has been a great meter for the price this one httpswwwamazoncominnovaautorangingdigitalmultimeterdpbevygzarefsrieutfqidsrkeywordsinnovavoltmeter for most infrequent homowner users who only want to measure voltage and occasional resistance this innova would be all the meter you ever needrecently i had the need to upgrade my multimeter as i also needed to measure capacitance after briefly shopping around for a good ""bang for the buck"" meter, i settled on this amprobe am multimeter in the end, i am glad i did this is an outstanding meter for the price, and just as good or better than meters that are twice the price read the reviews there are so many positive ones for good reason, this is a very good, durable multimeter for an outstanding price this meter bridges the gap between the infrequent user who just needs a voltmeter, and the professional who needs everything look at this meter as something a more discerning hobbyist or homeowner would buy if they want a ""do it all"" multimeter, and plans on using it frequentlyi could go on about what this meter does, but for that just read the description, or better yet the products webpage or manual or you could read the length reviews here on amazon that describe every feature and pick apart the meter as if it were a much more expensive, professional modelfor the price and the value you get with this amprobe an, this is highly recommendedthanks for readingpics attached first pic shows the innova meter i mention above, alongside the amprobe am in this ad notice the size difference the am is not compact or small, it is quite heft the second pic shows a close up of the innova, and the third pic a closeup of the am if you are on a budget, and dont need a myriad of features the innova is a great meter for supongo que es debido a la competencia de multmetros chinos y

solid unit with a case that is non slip on a slanted surface leads seat positively rotary selection is solid and engaging no variance in readings when compared to a more expensive meter good choice on my part, thanks to other positive reviews thanks amprobe for a quality productgood quality, i find that it is a bit slow to settle down at a reading sec but im used to mechanical probes which had instantaneous readings as long as you know how to read the scale as previously noted the noncontact voltage tester is fairly slow, and will not reliably penetrate walls so is fairly uselessthe burden voltage is unacceptably high in the ma range this makes it useless for the majority of my current measurements"

truck bed we shall see how that works once the snow and rain put it to the testi love the low profile and ease of installation as well as usei like the product and this is the second one i have had st tundra and nd tacoma however, the install was difficult on the tacoma the rails on the side of the bed when mounted did not all for the locking mechanism to work so i had to shim them about inch on both sides with a metal strip from home depot that was small problem, but the larger problem was the screw in clamps for the front piece would not fit into the preexisting tacoma bed track i would like someone from the company to contact me to resolvea small amount of water does get in if driving in a heavy rain storm it appears to be coming in thru the front corners i purchased a small length of gasket material same as on the cover and fixed the problem i suggest the manufacturer furnish this same length of gasket to the customer so that they can also make this little addition to the installation if necessaryhad some shipping damage and missing pieces but contacted undercover and they got everything straighten out quickly works great and looks great does let a little water in if you go to the car wash and spray it off good but under normal conditions it works great"

experience blast zombies, plants, and new characters across a mineblowing world that delivers the depth of a traditional online shooter blended with the refreshing humor of plants vs zombies take on coop and multiplayer action with your friends and sow the seeds of victory online play required",19.99,17.26,in stock,834,video games playstation games,"i would love to give this game stars, i really would in many ways it was more streamlined and better then the nd, but there is just a few too many glitches and issues to ignore wandering why you somehow got taken out by a soldier standing in an area that makes no sense youll find out several games later when the landscape doesnt form for you properly and you are doing the same things to other players there was one time i probably drove the plant team insane trying to figure out who the snot is shooting the sunflower lighthouse this will make sense once you play gardens and graveyards mode well is was menot inside the lighthouse because it was one of the few times ive had this occur to my advantageusing the garlic drone and engineer bot is risky business when those things get shot down, there is about a chance your game is just not going to load back properly to your actual characterthese and a few other glitches notwithstandingthis is the gold standard on how to do ""pack progression"" correctly random unlocks are nothing to be feared gamers have turned into spoiled little biotches thinking the entire game should be unlocked immediately the game rewards you for doing anything in the form of in game currency this then can be spent on a large assortment of ""sticker packs"" which give you anything from summonable zombies, plantable plants, cosmetic adjustments, modified abilities, new character variants which all play a bit differently from the base class with a different primary weapon and morethe game also rewards individual classes for doing their job engineers can make bank by establishing forward teleporter positions, making it easier for you team to raid and getting coins everytime someone then uses it cactus get extra coins if other classes are able to take advantage of well placed cover chompers get a hefty amount of coins for ""shield breaking"" the outer shell of tougher zombies with a burrow emerge no idea why this got omitted from the second game pretty much every class has special coin boosts and it promotes newer and inexperienced players to at least do their job if nothing elseas for basic random progression, this should be considered a good thing some folks will get frustrated that they dont get exactly the variants the want and have no where specific to go to find them, but the upside is it makes it a very unique experience for every player i still remember my first zombie unlock on my xbox one account, the goalie star to me, he looked great, did a little less damage then normal but slowed and froze enemies, and gave me my love for the allstar class a friend of mine unlocked the toxic pea first, arguably the best ""trooper"" type on the plant side, played that guy once and never looked back this makes for a fun experience where you never know what you are going to get these classes all have downsides to their standard variant, and dont break the game that some players get some before othersone could argue that there are upgrade stickers that get thrown into the sticker pool once a particular zombie or plant has been unlocked and they are too weak to play until you get those one, the upgrades are marginal two, you gain a crap ton of coins from the cooperative mode, garden ops, which you can play until you unlock those three, there is always the welcome matt you can play until you get enough coins to buy more packs to unlock their extrasfinally, the achievement vs experience system is great to level up your characters, you need accomplish achievements such us a particular move so many times, take out so many enemies, or even take out so many players some of these can be rather circumstantial, tricky, or just plain really difficult not to worry the packs have you covered on that as well as you are opening packs you get ""star challenge skip"" stickers which always you to automatically unlock that achievement so basically, however you want to play the game, you will eventually, through attrition, get everyone to max level anyway which is more a bragging thing then anything the later levels just give you additional coins, not more hit points or new stickers or anything it allows the game to be goal oriented, encourages players to try new things, but at the end of the day, if you are struggling or the other players are making it impossible to accomplish some take out bonk choy plants for exampleif the players arent planting them, you cant exactly get this done you can skip it and you earned it by some other means, since that was you sticker in your packso all and all, it would be nice for more games to use this overall method of progression if they are going the ""packloot box"" route with microtrans as a side income at no point did i feel i needed to buy additional coins, and there was an obvious ""pros vs cons"" for any character that i saw people using once i really got a decent amount of exposure to them before i got themas a side, the one exception was the tank commander zombie i was always floor how fast they could kill me all of a sudden and thought they must be broken and was confused i didnt see them moreuntil i unlocked him guy is literally running around with a tank cannon that is hard to hit with, doesnt do the greatest damage, until you crit on someone explains the sudden drops, and always explains the seldom usemuy buenokeeps grandson happy and was the perfect birthday giftmany of the star and star reviews seem to be motivated by the fact that the game must be played online with only a multiplayer mode and no single player campaign i think people can figure out for themselves whether this is a problem, and whether the price point is acceptable given the lack of single player campaign the rating should be based on the content that existsthe game is addictive, with classes leveling up for completing tasks usually for each level, such as ""vanquish zombies with your primary weapon"" or ""vanquish peashooters with imp punts"" some tasks are more onerous than others, but you can collect ""skip stars"" from card packs that you purchase with points that allow you to skip those tasks that you dont want to bother withthe number of points you earn is based on your performance in game typically rounds of gardens graveyards gg, a mode where zombies must occupy gardens in sequence, each for a certain amount of time and within a certain amount of time before advancing to the next garden will get you at least k points, with sticker packs costing anywhere from k for consumables to k for weapon upgrades, new characters, and consumables, with prices being based on the items they potentially contain its an addictive system that encourages you to play ""just one more game""as for the price point vs lack of single player campaign lets just say a game with only a single player campaign will typically take hours to complete the multiplayer for this game will keep you occupied for dozens upon dozens of hours, if not more to unlock every level for every character class could take you upwards of hours, so i dont personally see being cheated by no campaignas for my review of vs stars given my glowing remarksthere are a lot of hiccups with the servers usually out of every gg matches will have hang ups where characters start glitching and the game comes to a virtual halt about out of every or so gg matches will results in getting kicked to the starting menu, losing the opportunity to collect the points youve been earning in the matchthis is an absolutely adorable game the graphics arent too bad for a game meant to be silly the characters and class variations are very fun the game does not require you to buy coins to unlock characters, weapons or customizationsthe amount you can earn in game are quite generous, and i have never even considered paying for extra coins the publishers have continued to provide seasonal stickers and ingame variations, so that is a big plusthere are only two things i could gripe about is that the number of maps feels quite limited at times also, while they have ""classic vanquish"" or ""classic gardens and graveyards"" modes, not many people play those, and i usually end up solo that isnt against the game, it is just people queuing up in the other variationsthe second is the party system in garden open, you go to a screen where you can select the map, difficulty, invite friends, and all that, and it works well however, in standard multiplayer, it only has the option to ""join as party,"" meaning who you have in your ps party chat id be fine with this, however, the person who queues up finds a match, joins, and then it sends an invite to the other players via psn the personpeople then have to accept it, and hope that they can get into the matchand that they are on the same side my friend just got the game, we tried to play together, and it pitted me against himin my highest vanquish match everthis game is a rip off bought it for my grandson not having seen the one line that states you need ps plus or knowing what that is once you have paid for the game it wont let you play it until you pay a year extra to play online, which we dont want to do so you are buying a game you cant use, it is a ripoffpaid for this, then needed ps account at to be able to play the game combined price definitely not worth anywhere near this daylight robberygood game, but ive only given stars as you have to pay for playstation plus in order to use this, which is for months bought as a gift so i had no choice but to pay it or have a disappointed childthe game was for my grandson and he loves ituseless"

improvement in the hair, but also increase blood flow to your skull which i know red laser products do now when i sit and listen to my podcast every other day i can work on my head i like it too because i can pipe in the podcast to the earpieces i couldnt have had more simple instructions than these expected for sure very simple its very clearim happy with it you must use it every other day and you wont see results until after year if you have hair i think if you have very little hair you will see results sooner since it is easier to see the fine hairs growing with newly thinning hair it is hard to see the little hairs through the hair you have at first you may lose some hair this is a natural processmy dermatologist recommended this she also said that new hair growth was like baby fine hair then later it will thicken upone note of importance, if your hair had stopped growing years ago, it will not grow back you cannot be bald for a number of years and expect your hair to grow back a hair follicle gone for years or more will not come back but a hair follicle gone under years seems to be fine if you start when you see you are loosing hair, your chances of getting it back are good if you start when your hair is getting finer, this should work to thicken it up also, if you dont keep it up, you will go back to losing the hair this is a life commitment if you miss a few weeks because of vacation or traveling, it is okay, if your hair is coming back the bottom line is if you are home, do it every other day foreverthe helmet has a nice timer, has several differ patterns of lights for various hairloss types, is easy to usedo not be fooled that this looks like a gimicky, overly expensive product for gullible people ive been using this product consistently for months minutes every other day after the first two weeks, i noticed that my hair felt slightly different a little bit fuller, a little bit stronger for the first month, i still lost a decent amount of hair on the second, i lost very little hair then on the third month, i lost almost no hair at all there is almost no hair i see in the shower drain this product by itself has saved my hair even before buying this product, i did some of my own research even though their own research might be backed by them, i looked at others and they seem to come with a similar conclusion i have tried rogaine and rogaine has done nothing for me it is both messy and makes my scalp itch this product on the other was very simple to use it takes only button presses to start a minute session on the downside, i havent been able to grow the hair back at the front of my forehead, but i havent lost any hair either and my hairline is no longer receding this has given me hope that there will be better solutions down the line but at least im no longer losing hairwell, i have to say, its been four days now and i know im not imagining it the fistful clumps of hair falling out have stopped i had some emotional changes a month and a half ago, and my hair began falling out in clumps it began thinning all over no exposed scalp but just a lot less hair in general i know these cycles eventually stop, but this was getting stressful i had nice long hair and now just strands of hair hanging i wanted something that would stop more hair from falling out i used this more than recommended min the first day, and minutes the second and third days today i just used it for minutes until my scalp got all tingly from the device i can feel it working stimulating the follicles i think this might be the miracle i was looking for just to save the rest of my hair from falling out so fast it doesnt grow hair crazy fast like the biotin in rainbow light prenatal , but that is okay with me because i have processed hair and dont want fast grow out because i want to wait in between salon visits i just wanted the hair that i had to stay in excitedi have only had the product about days and have used it only twice recommends only twice a week or every other day at the most, so my review is only based on comfort and design cannot comment on the products ability to live up to its claims to regrow hair yetas for comfort and design, it is constructed well and is much easier to use than i thought it would be the controls are fool proof, where you simply choose a picture for what your baldness pattern looks like, then start it automatically stops after that particular programs time limit is reached no chance of overexposure or anything it is comfortable to wear and the builtin headphones are of decent quality too only issue is that when i want to watch tv instead of listening to a connected device through the headphone jack, i wish the headphones could be moved out of the way or removed entirely harder to hear, but not impossibleoverall, for the money i am satisfied but am far from noticing any hair growth results as it is way too earlyso, i reviewed this prior to finding out there is no return from the manufacturer if it doesnt work one of the reviews i read prior to purchasing it was from a buyer who said that after months he was able to return it to the manufacturer because he didnt get the results he wanted that was the only reason i purchased the igrow now i find out that the seller i purchased it from is not the manufacturer and that there is no return policy in place the company wont stand behind it because i didnt pay , their cost amazons return period expired so im stuck with the product you really have to be careful purchasing anything from amazon btw, the amazon credit card with chase is going to give you on only a small number of products that are amazon products the rest of them get just like you went to the store and used your card my love affair with amazon is over im not going to do all my christmas shopping with them like ive done in the last years its a pretty one sided relationshipscomodo da indossare perch pesa, e nessun beneficio

loves this chicken flavored weruva cats in the kitchen wet foodhe loves all the other flavors too except for the lamb one and one other i cant remember but it seems like this chicken one is his goto he licks the gravy but he also likes the real shredded chicken meat the seafood flavors contain chunks of fish with the skin and bones and he eats that sht up too like theres no tomorrowive tried to give him other fancy healthy brands on special occasions like his birthday and he turns his nose up and walks away to starve to death hes dramatic like thatweruva isnt the cheapest brand and it recently went up in price at my local pet store, so ordering a case of this from amazon is a more affordable option for my middle class lifestylethe chicken frick a zee flavor is a highquality food if youre looking for something thats high in protein and low in phosphorus and carbs the texture is a mix of coarse and fine shreds in gelee i usually mix it with additional water to ensure that the kitties are wellhydrated its a good choice if your cats like poultry flavorsother flavors also ticked the same boxes the isla bonita flavor is lower in phosphorus, but also slightly lower in protein and higher in carbs its also not as caloriedense as frick a zee however, so your kitty will need more weruvas paw lickin chicken is in some ways superior, but its more expensive frick a zee is lower in protein and higher in fat by comparison, but this isnt necessarily badlastly, if youre looking for something with no carbs at all, then check out tiki cat koolina luau its higher in protein, lower in phosphorus, and zero carb, but also more expensive than weruvaother pluses weruva as a company is transparent and informative on the nutritional content of their products this also played a role in my purchasing decisionthis is made of good ingredientsits highly rated for cats with urinary problems it looks and smells like chicken not glopmy cat hates itmy cat loves weruva cats in the kitchen chicken frick a zee i used to feed her a highquality dry food although shes an indoor only cat, twice she got outside and stayed gone for days before returning once when she somehow got out during my husbands office party, and once when the pet sitter left the back door open for the dog only to realize the next day that the cat had escaped doh the second time my cat ""escaped"" perhaps she considered the open door not an opportunity to escape but an invitation from the pet sitter she never has told me exactly, i made a promise that if she didnt become a tasty coyote snack, i would start feeding her wet food she did come back, and so began our negotiations over which wet cat food to feed her began i am pretty picky with the quality of the food that i feed her she is pretty picky about taste and her tastes have changed with wet foods over the past year any vegetables in her cat food make her vomit we happened upon chicken frick a zee awhile back, and it is still one of her favorite cat foods i love the quality and lack of any grains or veggies in it, and she loves the shredded chicken and overall taste i appreciate how fast i can get a case of the cans through amazon prime what i appreciate even more is the freshness of the cans that i bought i purchased the case in april , and the cans have a ""best by"" date of november cant beat that perhaps most importantly to me, bribing my cat with wet cat food daily seems to have stopped her need for any more ""walkabouts"" that, and finding a new pet sitter"
